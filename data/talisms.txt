No rest for the wicked and I am the wicked.
Another day, another dollar
The game's the game
I am in no mood for this
It is what it is
Fine, fair enough, next
Why are you like this ðŸ¤£
"On the bright hand" 
Big slay
That wiped me out
I am my mother's child
jesus fucking christ
I am going to shoot myself
What did I tell you
One second
I love to see it
I'm just a girl
I love that for me/you/us
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING
I am on the move
Woohoo!
I am going to lay
I am hanging on by a thread
skidaddle
You know what I mean
That was traumatic
lol okay
Fuck yeah
The way I ____
Comparison is the thief of joy
What goes around comes around
I'm taking the day
I am ready to be horizontal
MAN 
tell me about it
I feel like death
Ew
What can I say, I like what I like
Now I go sit in my bed
I'll get to it
I see the vision
I am a little ball of stress
*So* nice
And no one can tell me otherwise
What do I always say
