[29/09/2024, 17:13:38] Talia Reddy: How’s Eli 2.0
[29/09/2024, 17:15:15] Sabrina: Last night he asked me out
[29/09/2024, 17:15:24] Sabrina: After 2 weeks of literal silence
[29/09/2024, 17:15:41] Sabrina: And at the end of it, he held my hand, walked me home, and gave me a kiss
[29/09/2024, 17:16:09] Sabrina: Eli 2.0
[29/09/2024, 17:27:17] Talia Reddy: Fuck yeah
[29/09/2024, 17:37:09] Talia Reddy: Where did you go
[29/09/2024, 17:37:11] Talia Reddy: What did you do
[29/09/2024, 17:37:13] Talia Reddy: How did you feel
[29/09/2024, 17:43:15] Sabrina: A bar that had board games
[29/09/2024, 17:43:19] Sabrina: Played board games
[29/09/2024, 17:43:54] Sabrina: He’s suddenly texting me everyday now (granted it’s only been two) and it’s very different from the absolutely nothing of the past two weeks
[29/09/2024, 17:44:27] Sabrina: I mean after the date I thought, okay i have a crush it’s light it’s breezy i’m going with the flow things are good
[29/09/2024, 17:45:29] Sabrina: then now with the texting it’s feeling a little bit more than what i signed up for
but it could all just be in my head because i did point out to him the silence and he genuinely didn’t know that much time had passed
[29/09/2024, 18:00:22] Talia Reddy: That’s cute
[29/09/2024, 18:00:36] Talia Reddy: What did you sign up for
[29/09/2024, 18:00:48] Talia Reddy: Well if the time passed it passed
[29/09/2024, 18:00:56] Talia Reddy: If he genuinely didn’t know, that’s a different thing
[29/09/2024, 18:50:53] Sabrina: A small crush that would go nowhere and i could just keep crushing with semi-reciprocation
[29/09/2024, 18:59:22] Talia Reddy: That’s not how crushes work sis
[29/09/2024, 19:44:01] Sabrina: Oh hush
[29/09/2024, 19:44:07] Sabrina: How's the work hubby
[29/09/2024, 19:44:46] Talia Reddy: I’m in so deep dude
[29/09/2024, 19:44:56] Talia Reddy: Today he sent me a message saying he had a long weekend
[29/09/2024, 19:45:01] Talia Reddy: And then sent me photos of the dinner he made
[29/09/2024, 19:46:24] Talia Reddy: Sunday coffee?
[29/09/2024, 19:46:36] Talia Reddy: I like our lil tradition
[29/09/2024, 19:46:55] Sabrina: why of course but i hope you don’t mean today
[29/09/2024, 19:47:17] Sabrina: Live to hear that
[29/09/2024, 19:47:24] Sabrina: Love
[29/09/2024, 19:47:37] Sabrina: Did you tell him about your dad
[29/09/2024, 19:50:38] Talia Reddy: No not today 🤣
[29/09/2024, 19:50:41] Talia Reddy: Yes
[29/09/2024, 19:50:53] Talia Reddy: And I said I had to pick somewhere where he would like otherwise he wouldn’t eat
[29/09/2024, 19:50:58] Talia Reddy: And you know what he said
[29/09/2024, 19:51:05] Talia Reddy: I tried to shoot my shot
[29/09/2024, 19:51:10] Talia Reddy: And I was so slick with it
[29/09/2024, 22:41:06] Sabrina: What!!
[29/09/2024, 22:41:13] Sabrina: And???
[29/09/2024, 22:49:32] Talia Reddy: He said to me
That sounds like his problem, not yours
[29/09/2024, 22:51:27] Talia Reddy: Basically we were talking about him and I are both flirts 
And then I said I’m not the one who got with someone here
And then he said well, who would you get with then
So I kinda of just looked at him and tilted my head towards him and he just made a face like hm okay
[29/09/2024, 22:51:30] Talia Reddy: And then something happened
[29/09/2024, 22:51:34] Talia Reddy: But I was pretty slick
[29/09/2024, 22:51:40] Talia Reddy: Idk if he caught it
[30/09/2024, 00:57:39] Sabrina: That is the right thing to say
[30/09/2024, 00:57:45] Sabrina: But also unhelpful
[30/09/2024, 00:58:03] Sabrina: How the tables have turned
[30/09/2024, 00:58:08] Sabrina: Are you gonna point it out to him
[30/09/2024, 09:07:34] Talia Reddy: I didn’t want helpful 
It was like the best answer
[30/09/2024, 09:07:45] Talia Reddy: No absolutely not

[11/11/2024, 22:53:45] Sabrina: IM DYING
[11/11/2024, 22:54:36] Sabrina: This is the online scams my mother warned me about as a child
[11/11/2024, 22:54:41] Sabrina: Wth 🤣🤣🤣
[11/11/2024, 22:54:40] Talia Reddy: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
[11/11/2024, 22:54:43] Talia Reddy: Tbf
[11/11/2024, 22:54:46] Talia Reddy: I’m getting a refund
[11/11/2024, 22:54:47] Talia Reddy: But
[11/11/2024, 22:54:50] Talia Reddy: That’s not the point
[11/11/2024, 22:54:58] Talia Reddy: I laughed so hard
[11/11/2024, 22:54:59] Sabrina: Oh this is hilarious
[11/11/2024, 22:55:07] Talia Reddy: How’s the new place
[11/11/2024, 22:55:09] Sabrina: Did you message the seller being like wtf
[11/11/2024, 22:55:25] Sabrina: The ex is gonna move in soon and he’s so much friendlier so i’m quite exited
[11/11/2024, 22:55:31] Sabrina: how’s the work
[11/11/2024, 22:56:38] Talia Reddy: lol he’s
[11/11/2024, 22:56:39] Talia Reddy: Yes
[11/11/2024, 22:56:44] Talia Reddy: They processed it as a refund
[11/11/2024, 22:56:49] Talia Reddy: So I’m going to return it
[11/11/2024, 22:56:55] Talia Reddy: I had such a cute outfit planned
[11/11/2024, 22:57:05] Talia Reddy: This set up is so confusing
[11/11/2024, 22:57:09] Talia Reddy: Is she not friendly
[11/11/2024, 22:57:12] Talia Reddy: Busy
[11/11/2024, 22:57:15] Sabrina: Whaaaat? Why?
[11/11/2024, 22:57:14] Talia Reddy: So busy
[11/11/2024, 22:57:21] Talia Reddy: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
[11/11/2024, 22:57:23] Talia Reddy: Guess why
[11/11/2024, 22:57:28] Sabrina: I can imagine!
It takes ages for these vinted packages to arrive i guess
[11/11/2024, 22:57:38] Talia Reddy: lol yes
[11/11/2024, 22:57:40] Sabrina: It takes effort to return, i wouldn’t be asked
[11/11/2024, 22:58:23] Sabrina: I’d go with more reserved
But also she’s probably went through a big breakup so maybe this is her process
[11/11/2024, 22:59:08] Talia Reddy: Well I can’t keep it
[11/11/2024, 22:59:16] Talia Reddy: Yeah that makes sense
[11/11/2024, 22:59:22] Talia Reddy: Better than the old place I’m assuming
[11/11/2024, 22:59:27] Talia Reddy: I can’t wait to get Zoe out
[11/11/2024, 23:00:12] Sabrina: So much better
[11/11/2024, 23:00:21] Sabrina: I can’t wait to live with you
[11/11/2024, 23:00:30] Sabrina: I realise i much prefer a roommate rn than a studio
[11/11/2024, 23:00:43] Sabrina: I’m surprised the seller is nice enough to take it back
[11/11/2024, 23:00:53] Sabrina: Also surely they should’ve known this is a child’s coat
[11/11/2024, 23:01:10] Talia Reddy: That’s good - I’m happy
[11/11/2024, 23:01:27] Talia Reddy: I get that too
[11/11/2024, 23:01:30] Talia Reddy: Hehe
[11/11/2024, 23:01:36] Talia Reddy: lol because they know
[11/11/2024, 23:01:44] Talia Reddy: Vinted would probably intervene
[11/11/2024, 23:01:52] Talia Reddy: They did and I think that’s why
[11/11/2024, 23:01:57] Talia Reddy: They knew they were going
[11/11/2024, 23:02:01] Talia Reddy: Wrong*^
[11/11/2024, 23:02:44] Talia Reddy: What happened with your deposit?
[11/11/2024, 23:05:04] Sabrina: I thought you went directly to vinted to intervene
[11/11/2024, 23:05:22] Sabrina: Man that’s crazy, this is so funny this happened to you
[11/11/2024, 23:05:28] Sabrina: Still in the process of fighting for it
[11/11/2024, 23:07:28] Talia Reddy: No I just logged a report and the seller accepted it as a return
[11/11/2024, 23:07:32] Talia Reddy: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
[11/11/2024, 23:07:34] Talia Reddy: Life
[11/11/2024, 23:07:43] Talia Reddy: Has she said anything
[11/11/2024, 23:08:11] Talia Reddy: This bitch spilled coffee on the couch and she didn’t even mention anything
[11/11/2024, 23:08:14] Talia Reddy: She just left it
[11/11/2024, 23:09:18] Talia Reddy: And then when I asked her
[11/11/2024, 23:09:30] Talia Reddy: She said oh yeah that was me, don’t worry, I’ll clean it
[11/11/2024, 23:12:55] Sabrina: Well she tried getting 400 euros from me saying the landlord wants it, then the landlord messaged me asking why she’s asking him for 400

[09/12/2024, 16:25:56] Sabrina: 👍
[09/12/2024, 16:26:03] Sabrina: How’s SA hows the rest
[10/12/2024, 07:06:03] Talia Reddy: You need to message them and say you’re the tenant taking over from Zoe and would like to know what documents you need to provide
[10/12/2024, 07:19:07] Talia Reddy: In order to go onto the lease
[10/12/2024, 11:48:51] Talia Reddy: Today is Caleb’s birthday
[10/12/2024, 12:33:34] Sabrina: How are you doing
[10/12/2024, 13:18:06] Talia Reddy: Pretty good
[10/12/2024, 13:18:09] Talia Reddy: Didn’t even realise
[10/12/2024, 13:34:47] Sabrina: Good for you
[10/12/2024, 13:34:55] Sabrina: We love that
[10/12/2024, 22:11:02] Talia Reddy: MAKE SURE SHE IS OUT
[10/12/2024, 22:11:15] Talia Reddy: Look everywhere
[10/12/2024, 22:11:20] Talia Reddy: Before you let her go
[10/12/2024, 22:11:28] Talia Reddy: Fucking ridiculous
[10/12/2024, 22:11:46] Sabrina: did something happen
[10/12/2024, 22:11:59] Talia Reddy: Hey sorry for not answering but I have exams these days. I made some research and it’s not like u said about registration. From the moment im not on the contract anymore, I will result not registered to this house. I’m sorry but I told you that I can’t register to this new house, so I have to stay registered here, at least until March.
[10/12/2024, 22:12:12] Talia Reddy: I mean I had no problem with you being registered till Jan but till March is a really long time especially considering you’ve only paid rent till November.
That’s 4 months where you registered at the house where I’m paying the full rent…
[10/12/2024, 22:12:12] Talia Reddy: I’m not particularly comfortable with that arrangement, I’m sorry. 
I don’t think it’s fair for you to stay on the contract after I’ve given you back the money for the contract, I’ve covered December rent myself and let you stay there till 19th which is basically half your rent free.
[10/12/2024, 22:12:12] Talia Reddy: I’ve covered €870 basically for the inconvenience. 
€300 for the contract
And 19 days rent which is about €570
[10/12/2024, 22:12:19] Talia Reddy: First message is here
[10/12/2024, 22:12:21] Talia Reddy: Hers
[10/12/2024, 22:13:36] Sabrina: Jesus
[10/12/2024, 22:13:46] Talia Reddy: Like fuck yoi
[10/12/2024, 22:14:12] Sabrina: I can’t believe she’s not paying for december
[10/12/2024, 22:14:27] Sabrina: Also man you were too nice to her
[10/12/2024, 22:14:49] Talia Reddy: I really was.
[10/12/2024, 22:15:18] Talia Reddy: I might have to sort out a correspondence address for you
[10/12/2024, 22:17:18] Sabrina: You’re gonna let her stay registered?
[10/12/2024, 22:17:45] Talia Reddy: No
[10/12/2024, 22:17:56] Talia Reddy: But it may take me longer than Jan to sort it out entirely
[10/12/2024, 22:18:35] Sabrina: You think she’s not gonna leave without a fight?
[10/12/2024, 22:19:33] Talia Reddy: I don’t know
[10/12/2024, 22:19:37] Talia Reddy: But I have a solution
[10/12/2024, 22:20:02] Talia Reddy: I think we might need to get you a correspondence address with me
[10/12/2024, 22:20:06] Talia Reddy: It’s basically a temp address
[10/12/2024, 22:20:13] Talia Reddy: As long as you have a BSN 
You’re good
[10/12/2024, 22:20:22] Talia Reddy: Till we get you a full one
[10/12/2024, 22:21:31] Talia Reddy: She’s such a little bitch
[10/12/2024, 22:21:34] Talia Reddy: I’m in such a bad mood
[10/12/2024, 22:22:17] Sabrina: Aw this is reminding me of my fight with the crazy greek lady
[10/12/2024, 22:22:24] Talia Reddy: Fuck me
[10/12/2024, 22:22:29] Talia Reddy: But in my own house
[10/12/2024, 22:22:33] Sabrina: Yeah
[10/12/2024, 22:22:38] Sabrina: After you were so nice to her
[10/12/2024, 22:22:45] Talia Reddy: Truly.
[11/12/2024, 15:17:23] Sabrina: I've got no hot water at home again till friday, do you mind if i shower at yours
[11/12/2024, 15:17:38] Talia Reddy: Go for it
[11/12/2024, 15:19:38] Sabrina: Heh thanks
[11/12/2024, 16:19:48] Talia Reddy: Are you going to the apartment today?
[11/12/2024, 16:20:38] Sabrina: possibly
[11/12/2024, 16:20:48] Sabrina: Need summin?
[11/12/2024, 16:20:54] Talia Reddy: See if Zoe is there
[11/12/2024, 16:21:06] Talia Reddy: And tell her to fucking respond to my emails
[11/12/2024, 16:21:25] Sabrina: Oo nee is she avoiding you
[11/12/2024, 16:49:55] Talia Reddy: Messages*^
[11/12/2024, 16:49:55] Talia Reddy: Not emails
[11/12/2024, 16:50:04] Talia Reddy: Ja wel
[11/12/2024, 16:50:21] Talia Reddy: Demo ik
[11/12/2024, 16:50:24] Talia Reddy: Denk*
[11/12/2024, 16:50:35] Sabrina: haha tuurlijk
[11/12/2024, 16:53:04] Talia Reddy: lil bitch
[11/12/2024, 17:34:51] Talia Reddy: She drives me insane.
[11/12/2024, 17:35:43] Sabrina: hopefully not too much longer you'll have to deal with her
[11/12/2024, 17:36:04] Talia Reddy: I understand what u’re saying, but im moving in a house w no registration since it was the only option i found for january. However, I’ll send an email to the landlord about me leaving in February, so that u’re friend can register from February
[11/12/2024, 17:36:04] Talia Reddy: Yeah i understand that but I’ve let you stay this month rent free.
[11/12/2024, 17:36:05] Talia Reddy: I would prefer if you pay for half of December then as you’re only planning to be off the contract from February which wasn’t our arrangement.
[11/12/2024, 17:36:05] Talia Reddy: I’ve been accommodating enough for the inconvenience
[11/12/2024, 17:36:05] Talia Reddy: I didn’t ask you for deposit even though I should’ve. You’ve been smoking in your room and I’m probably going to have repaint because they are going to take from my deposit. 
I gave you the 300 back 
I would like at least €400 for this month that you’re staying if you’re only planning to get off in feb
[11/12/2024, 17:38:09] Sabrina: imo you shouldn't let her stay registered
or at least not for free
[11/12/2024, 17:38:40] Sabrina: geez she sounds frustrating
[11/12/2024, 17:39:38] Talia Reddy: Yeah I shouldn’t
[11/12/2024, 17:40:47] Sabrina: Glad you're finally asking for the rent for december from her
[11/12/2024, 17:40:51] Talia Reddy: Yes
[11/12/2024, 17:40:53] Talia Reddy: I’m going to
[11/12/2024, 17:41:38] Talia Reddy: I told her she either pays be €250 in Jan
[11/12/2024, 17:41:43] Talia Reddy: Or her full rent in December
[11/12/2024, 17:44:20] Sabrina: Good idea
[12/12/2024, 12:04:34] Talia Reddy: Did you go to the house
[12/12/2024, 12:04:36] Talia Reddy: Has she burnt it
[12/12/2024, 12:04:53] Talia Reddy: I think I lost my bracelet
Not my favorite bracelet so I’m not super mad but I’m annnoued

Mess like pizza boxes and beer bottles everywhere

[24/01/2025, 22:19:48] Sabrina: yes!
[26/01/2025, 09:22:23] Sabrina: Hey, I handled things really badly, I want to hear you out and apologise, I'm here if and when you want to talk.
[26/01/2025, 09:28:13] Talia Reddy: I don’t really have much to say about it. I didn’t like Zoe’s boyfriend being here which I explicitly vented to you about and you went and did the exact same thing. You spent the whole day at home and conveniently didn’t tell me until Caleb was here where you knew I couldn’t even be visibly bothered while he was here. I felt very cornered. 
Your relationship with Santiago is none of my business, but you’ve known him for a week or whatever and then brought him to stay here without any heads up. Like I said, I don’t care that he was here, I’m just pissed that you didn’t tell me and only chose to do it when Caleb came. 

I’m on the phone with my mom, that’s why I’m typing 
You can come just now when I’m done if you want to talk
[26/01/2025, 09:31:39] Sabrina: Yeah I really screwed up and I really want to talk to you about it
[26/01/2025, 09:34:00] Talia Reddy: Come by later I’ll tell you when I’m done
[26/01/2025, 12:30:45] Talia Reddy: Are you home yet
[26/01/2025, 12:31:11] Sabrina: just got back
[26/01/2025, 12:32:36] Talia Reddy: Are you going to work from home
[26/01/2025, 12:32:47] Talia Reddy: Or take your laptop somewhere
[26/01/2025, 12:33:07] Sabrina: probably from home
[26/01/2025, 12:33:20] Sabrina: calling my parents later

[28/01/2025, 17:46:01] Talia Reddy: lol
[29/01/2025, 00:31:52] Sabrina: Hey, I want to clear something up. I realise I may have given you mixed signals,, but the other night crossed a line I had already set, and I'm not actually okay with it. 
I'm going to stay abstinent for at least til I graduate. It's not about you, it's also not about the long game. I'm not looking for a relationship. I'm just looking to stay fully clothed with other fully clothed people.
No hard feelings, but if you're unable to deal with this, then it's best we don't hang out again. ‎<This message was edited>
