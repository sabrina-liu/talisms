[27/02/2021, 07:33:56] Sabrina: See?
[27/02/2021, 07:33:59] Sabrina: Not weird
[27/02/2021, 07:34:31] ~Talia✨: I like it on you better
[27/02/2021, 14:06:19] Sabrina: Am I that oblivious to everything that goes on
[27/02/2021, 14:06:36] ~Talia✨: Why?
[27/02/2021, 14:08:06] Sabrina: A kid has been coming to my house every weekend for a month now and I had no idea
[27/02/2021, 14:08:25] Sabrina: Sebs been teaching him maths
[27/02/2021, 14:08:37] Sabrina: Like how would I not know
And my whole family knows but me
[27/02/2021, 14:08:44] Sabrina: It blows my mind
[27/02/2021, 14:08:53] ~Talia✨: Wait
[27/02/2021, 14:08:54] ~Talia✨: How
[27/02/2021, 14:09:00] Sabrina: I don’t know!
[27/02/2021, 14:09:05] ~Talia✨: Like how could you not know
‎[27/02/2021, 14:09:23] Sabrina: ‎image omitted
[27/02/2021, 14:09:36] Sabrina: I know right!
[27/02/2021, 14:09:42] ~Talia✨: No you really are oblivious
[27/02/2021, 14:09:57] Sabrina: It’s kind of impossible and yet it’s possible
[27/02/2021, 14:10:19] Sabrina: And I only found out because seb asked if I had whiteboard markers
[27/02/2021, 14:10:19] ~Talia✨: Sis 
A whole month
[27/02/2021, 14:10:25] Sabrina: And it’s his last lesson today
[27/02/2021, 14:10:28] Sabrina: I would have never known
[27/02/2021, 14:10:47] Sabrina: And apparently last week his brother came and just roamed the house for an hour
[27/02/2021, 14:10:54] Sabrina: Had a cat chat with my dad as well
[27/02/2021, 14:11:01] Sabrina: fat chat*
[27/02/2021, 14:11:02] ~Talia✨: Maybe you can do that tomorrow sleeping
[27/02/2021, 14:11:09] ~Talia✨: You were sleeping *^
[27/02/2021, 14:11:38] Sabrina: Probably 50% of his visits I was
[27/02/2021, 14:11:59] Sabrina: But there’s no way I’ve been consistently asleep from 3-4 every weekend
[27/02/2021, 14:12:16] ~Talia✨: Then you’re just oblivious
[27/02/2021, 14:12:30] Sabrina: We’re complete opposites 😂
[27/02/2021, 14:12:37] Sabrina: You know everything that goes on with everything
[27/02/2021, 14:12:46] Sabrina: I know nothing that goes on with nothing
[27/02/2021, 14:12:49] ~Talia✨: Because I’m nosy
[27/02/2021, 14:12:57] Sabrina: And I’m blind and deaf
[27/02/2021, 14:14:25] ~Talia✨: Clearly
[27/02/2021, 14:14:36] ~Talia✨: Which is ironic considering I am the blind one
[27/02/2021, 14:14:54] Sabrina: Yeah 🤣
[27/02/2021, 14:15:02] Sabrina: How was the optometrist
[27/02/2021, 14:15:12] Sabrina: Did you get the contact in in the end
[27/02/2021, 14:15:47] ~Talia✨: They canceled cause I wasn’t wearing it long enough
[27/02/2021, 14:16:02] Sabrina: What was the appointment for
[27/02/2021, 14:16:16] Sabrina: To check how your eye was doing?
[27/02/2021, 14:16:35] ~Talia✨: No to see if my contacts adjusted
[27/02/2021, 14:16:41] ~Talia✨: But I didn’t wear them so
[27/02/2021, 14:16:44] Sabrina: Ah
[27/02/2021, 14:16:51] ~Talia✨: Yes
[27/02/2021, 14:16:52] Sabrina: You should maybe probably start doing that
[27/02/2021, 14:17:09] ~Talia✨: Great suggestion
Thanks
[27/02/2021, 14:17:20] Sabrina: Always glad to be of assistance
[27/02/2021, 14:17:31] ~Talia✨: Appreciate it sis
[27/02/2021, 14:18:02] Sabrina: Get this
[27/02/2021, 14:18:08] ~Talia✨: Yee
[27/02/2021, 14:18:35] Sabrina: The woman at the store cracked my screen protector as she put it on, and I didn’t notice it until I got home and took it out
[27/02/2021, 14:19:00] Sabrina: I saw it at the store but I thought it was a hair or something
[27/02/2021, 14:19:19] Sabrina: So my record time for an uncracked screen protector is apparently a second
[27/02/2021, 14:20:36] ~Talia✨: Oh wow.
[27/02/2021, 14:20:38] ~Talia✨: I mean
[27/02/2021, 14:20:40] ~Talia✨: Shorter than mine
[27/02/2021, 14:21:05] Sabrina: I should report it as a Guinness world record
[27/02/2021, 14:21:58] ~Talia✨: My friends brother got a phone
[27/02/2021, 14:22:06] ~Talia✨: And on the way to the car he dropped it and cracked it
[27/02/2021, 14:22:20] Sabrina: Oh my god that’s unlucky
[27/02/2021, 14:22:28] ~Talia✨: So unlucky
[27/02/2021, 14:22:33] ~Talia✨: Funny 
But unlucky
[27/02/2021, 15:41:00] ~Talia✨: Can I tell you.
[27/02/2021, 15:41:53] Sabrina: And then she stops typing
[27/02/2021, 15:41:58] ~Talia✨: Oh
[27/02/2021, 15:42:02] ~Talia✨: I was waiting for a yes
[27/02/2021, 15:42:08] ~Talia✨: Build up emphasis
[27/02/2021, 15:42:14] ~Talia✨: Anyways
[27/02/2021, 15:42:15] Sabrina: Of course
[27/02/2021, 15:42:20] Sabrina: You want the dramaticism
[27/02/2021, 15:42:22] ~Talia✨: Yk me and how I am
[27/02/2021, 15:42:24] ~Talia✨: Ofc

Like what have I become
[27/02/2021, 15:43:05] ~Talia✨: A hoe to a housewife
[27/02/2021, 15:43:28] Sabrina: I think making a bed ranks one higher than that but still geez
[27/02/2021, 15:43:39] Sabrina: Didn’t think married life would hit you so early
[27/02/2021, 15:44:05] ~Talia✨: But still geez
[27/02/2021, 15:44:21] Sabrina: How was the stay
[27/02/2021, 15:44:54] ~Talia✨: Didn’t really stay over cause of logistical issues
[27/02/2021, 15:45:00] ~Talia✨: But spent most of my time there with him
[27/02/2021, 15:45:04] ~Talia✨: Neither did I.

[27/02/2021, 15:46:50] Sabrina: “When it’s the one, it’s the one”
[27/02/2021, 15:46:53] ~Talia✨: He says to me a 
“ a baby with the curls and your eyes, my god”
[27/02/2021, 15:47:12] ~Talia✨: No we never thought we’d the type
[27/02/2021, 15:48:17] Sabrina: No like

[27/02/2021, 15:48:23] ~Talia✨: I know
[27/02/2021, 15:48:24] ~Talia✨: But
[27/02/2021, 15:48:26] Sabrina: Tbf it is quite dramatic
[27/02/2021, 15:48:28] Sabrina: Like
[27/02/2021, 15:48:33] ~Talia✨: It’s very dramatic
[27/02/2021, 15:48:41] Sabrina: You’ve excerciesed the word dramatic to talk full extent
[27/02/2021, 15:48:51] ~Talia✨: Yebo

[27/02/2021, 15:49:27] ~Talia✨: Wow
[27/02/2021, 15:49:46] Sabrina: Seb asks why you needed my number
[27/02/2021, 15:50:06] ~Talia✨: Oh cause my number was registered and it kicked me out
[27/02/2021, 15:50:19] ~Talia✨: So I wanted a new account
[27/02/2021, 15:50:25] ~Talia✨: And I needed to use your number
[27/02/2021, 15:50:32] Sabrina: It kicked you out?
[27/02/2021, 15:50:45] ~Talia✨: Yeah but it was cause I was underage
[27/02/2021, 15:50:47] ~Talia✨: So it didn’t matter
[27/02/2021, 15:50:52] Sabrina: Why didn’t you tell him to make one 😂
[27/02/2021, 15:50:56] ~Talia✨: I used a different one
[27/02/2021, 15:51:01] ~Talia✨: Didn’t wanna
[27/02/2021, 15:51:11] ~Talia✨: It was my thing
[27/02/2021, 15:51:28] Sabrina: Sometimes there’s really no point trying to argue with your logic
[27/02/2021, 15:51:38] ~Talia✨: Because it’s bad?
[27/02/2021, 15:52:02] Sabrina: Mostly dumb, but yes also bad
[27/02/2021, 15:52:22] ~Talia✨: It’s fine
[27/02/2021, 15:52:26] ~Talia✨: I sorted it out anyways
[27/02/2021, 15:52:32] ~Talia✨: And I got my nice little suite
[27/02/2021, 15:52:48] Sabrina: But you didn’t
[27/02/2021, 15:52:53] ~Talia✨: And I got to sit in a bubble bath with him and put bubbles all over his face
[27/02/2021, 15:53:10] Sabrina: But your hair
[27/02/2021, 15:53:31] ~Talia✨: But I did?
I just got it on another system
[27/02/2021, 15:53:39] ~Talia✨: Tied it up
[27/02/2021, 15:53:45] Sabrina: You didn’t even stay for the bed or the breakfast
[27/02/2021, 15:53:45] ~Talia✨: He said the same thing 😂🥺
[27/02/2021, 15:53:53] ~Talia✨: We went back this morning
[27/02/2021, 15:54:02] ~Talia✨: And spent most of the day there
[27/02/2021, 15:54:08] ~Talia✨: And basically the whole of yesterday
[27/02/2021, 15:55:04] Sabrina: Your logic really baffles me
[27/02/2021, 15:55:13] ~Talia✨: It wasn’t supposed to be like that
[28/02/2021, 06:49:55] ~Talia✨: Question
[28/02/2021, 07:58:14] Sabrina: Yeah?
[28/02/2021, 08:05:25] ~Talia✨: Did we end up writing that maths test with booi
[28/02/2021, 08:05:54] Sabrina: No
[28/02/2021, 08:06:45] ~Talia✨: That’s crazy
[28/02/2021, 08:23:10] ~Talia✨: Lemme tell you
[28/02/2021, 08:23:34] Sabrina: Yes?
[28/02/2021, 08:25:20] ~Talia✨: Tweeds is a lot more serious than I am when it comes to long term 
And I don’t know if it’s cause I’m scared
[28/02/2021, 08:25:32] ~Talia✨: Or I just don’t think like that
[28/02/2021, 08:31:02] Sabrina: Scared is the normal reaction
[28/02/2021, 08:31:14] ~Talia✨: Sis
[28/02/2021, 08:31:36] ~Talia✨: He put my name and his surname together and goes: “ it doesn’t sound too bad yeah, has a nice ring to it”
[28/02/2021, 08:33:20] Sabrina: Sounds like you’re not in it as serious as he is
[28/02/2021, 08:33:34] ~Talia✨: I am
[28/02/2021, 08:33:43] ~Talia✨: Because the worst part is
[28/02/2021, 08:33:48] ~Talia✨: I didn’t mind it at all
[28/02/2021, 08:33:56] Sabrina: Then you’re not scared
[28/02/2021, 08:34:16] ~Talia✨: I just didn’t know I could be this serious
[28/02/2021, 08:34:19] Sabrina: It’s not necessarily bad
[28/02/2021, 08:34:20] ~Talia✨: It’s a new world
[28/02/2021, 08:34:28] ~Talia✨: It’s not 
But it is scary
[28/02/2021, 08:34:30] Sabrina: Well go with the flow
[28/02/2021, 08:34:38] ~Talia✨: Trying to
[28/02/2021, 08:34:39] Sabrina: But you’re not scared
[28/02/2021, 08:34:52] ~Talia✨: I’m not scared of it 
But the idea within itself is scary
[28/02/2021, 08:35:07] Sabrina: Sure it is
[28/02/2021, 08:35:17] Sabrina: But if it’s not scary to you then you shouldn’t be worried
[28/02/2021, 08:35:24] ~Talia✨: Fair enough
[28/02/2021, 08:35:33] Sabrina: It’s like horror movies are scary but not all people are scared by it
[28/02/2021, 08:36:00] ~Talia✨: I guess so
[28/02/2021, 08:36:04] Sabrina: If he puts your name with his surname and you don’t mind, might as well go with it
[28/02/2021, 08:36:41] ~Talia✨: I don’t wanna have expectations for something that isn’t gonna work out like that
[28/02/2021, 08:36:51] Sabrina: You don’t know that it won’t
[28/02/2021, 08:37:00] ~Talia✨: I don’t know that it will either
[28/02/2021, 08:37:18] Sabrina: It’s not even expectation
[28/02/2021, 08:37:21] Sabrina: It’s just a thought
[28/02/2021, 08:37:42] Sabrina: It’s just a nice thought that he thought and shared it with you
[28/02/2021, 08:37:51] Sabrina: It’s not confirming a marriage proposal
[28/02/2021, 08:37:53] ~Talia✨: Yeah you’re right
[28/02/2021, 08:38:12] ~Talia✨: It’s not no

[28/02/2021, 08:41:19] ~Talia✨: And he was like 
You were on your own steez
[28/02/2021, 08:41:37] ~Talia✨: And I said to her

[28/02/2021, 08:41:41] ~Talia✨: Finally😂😂
[28/02/2021, 08:42:05] ~Talia✨: Cause this could be have longevity
[28/02/2021, 08:43:33] Sabrina: Thing is 
If his reasons were more valid, I wouldn’t have been as pissed
[28/02/2021, 08:43:53] ~Talia✨: Yeah I know where you were coming from sis 😂

[01/03/2021, 17:45:00] ~Talia✨: hey everyone 
i hope that half term has been really enjoyable and restful :) 
This week is interhouse swimming (wow!) and we don’t have a team 
so this is a call to absolutely everyone: please do swim.
we’re allowed to miss lessons to swim, but aren’t allowed to miss tests. so if you’ve got a test on one of the days, don’t sign up.
tuesday and thursday start at 15:00 and wednesday starts at 14:00 

feel free to volunteer on here so that we can all congratulate and thank you 

these are the events ^ 
the numbers being how long the races are (in metres)
lastly, we obviously need four people to volunteer for the relay events that aren’t individual relays

thank you all so much :)

You don’t exactly broadcast your relationship to the world, but if people ask you don’t hide it
[11/03/2021, 18:42:03] ~Talia✨: Yeah I think so
[11/03/2021, 18:42:12] ~Talia✨: Everyone can put two and two together

[11/03/2021, 18:46:03] ~Talia✨: Yes
[11/03/2021, 18:46:07] Sabrina: And I make a joke and I said

[11/03/2021, 18:48:59] ~Talia✨: Fair enough
[11/03/2021, 18:49:48] Sabrina: Between you it’s all “this is actually a possibility”

[13/03/2021, 16:43:21] ~Talia✨: That’s crazy
‎[13/03/2021, 20:31:20] Sabrina: ‎image omitted
[13/03/2021, 20:35:12] ~Talia✨: Exactly that
[14/03/2021, 18:26:56] ~Talia✨: Yk dude
[14/03/2021, 18:26:58] ~Talia✨: This is random
[14/03/2021, 18:27:00] ~Talia✨: And deep
[14/03/2021, 18:27:59] Sabrina: Yes?
[14/03/2021, 18:28:46] ~Talia✨: Caleb and I were speaking in the car yesterday
[14/03/2021, 18:28:51] ~Talia✨: Just about life and everything
[14/03/2021, 18:29:03] ~Talia✨: He starts talking about how he’d parent his kids and shit
[14/03/2021, 18:29:30] Sabrina: Okay
[14/03/2021, 18:30:08] ~Talia✨: And I realized
[14/03/2021, 18:30:27] ~Talia✨: We have two very different views on kids
[14/03/2021, 18:31:14] Sabrina: Different childhoods different upbringings yeah that makes sense
[14/03/2021, 18:31:20] ~Talia✨: Very different
[14/03/2021, 18:31:29] ~Talia✨: Him and I were raised completely differently
[14/03/2021, 18:31:54] Sabrina: And the problem is
[14/03/2021, 18:32:14] ~Talia✨: The more we speak about children the more I realize I don’t want them
[14/03/2021, 18:32:49] Sabrina: Your reasoning for not wanting them isn’t because of the sake of having children themselves
[14/03/2021, 18:32:57] ~Talia✨: And me saying I’d consider them with him is a lie because I’m not meant to be a mother
[14/03/2021, 18:34:03] Sabrina: That’s not necessarily true
[14/03/2021, 18:38:37] ~Talia✨: Not entirely
[14/03/2021, 18:38:57] ~Talia✨: But partially
[14/03/2021, 18:40:03] ~Talia✨: I also realised 
A lot of arguments are gonna stem from I want to take care of you vs I can take care of myself
[14/03/2021, 19:24:59] Sabrina: https://vm.tiktok.com/ZSJN7xqw7/

[14/03/2021, 19:32:54] ~Talia✨: I’m assuming that’s Mandela’s hun
[14/03/2021, 19:33:48] Sabrina: I can’t tell if you’re making a joke or if you’re being serious

Saw my cousin who left the family about a decade ago
Saw some st Andrew’s friends that hate me
[21/03/2021, 15:47:36] Sabrina: Oh wow
[21/03/2021, 15:47:37] ~Talia✨: Oh woah
[21/03/2021, 15:47:40] ~Talia✨: Wait

[21/03/2021, 15:47:57] Sabrina: Everyone there is
[21/03/2021, 15:48:20] ~Talia✨: Why’d dad tear up? 
I know you have intimacy issues, how’d that come to your attention? 
Left the family? 
People exist who hate you? Who could hate you?
[21/03/2021, 15:48:24] ~Talia✨: We try
‎[21/03/2021, 15:49:08] ~Talia✨: ‎image omitted
[21/03/2021, 15:50:59] Sabrina: He thinks he’s failed as a father
made me real uncomfortable
Couple years back my aunt divorced my uncle to be dramatic and she regrets it
Ugh i don’t know why either 
It’s the whole thing of I don’t like it when people don’t like me but eh
[21/03/2021, 15:51:10] Sabrina: Aw this is so precious
[21/03/2021, 15:51:43] ~Talia✨: Why does he think that?
Moms side or dad? 
Don’t let people’s opinion of you being you down
[21/03/2021, 15:51:46] ~Talia✨: Bring*^
[21/03/2021, 15:51:54] Sabrina: And I’m scared of sleeping at night cause I keep getting nightmares
[21/03/2021, 15:52:05] ~Talia✨: Nightmares of?
[21/03/2021, 15:52:20] ~Talia✨: Wait 
How’d the intimacy thing come about?
[21/03/2021, 15:53:27] Sabrina: He shows affection in a different way and he thinks it’s a bad thing
Dads side
Nah it’s inevitable but I’m aware of it at least
[21/03/2021, 15:53:54] Sabrina: Just hidden fears are arising and idk it’s suddenly been tormenting me for a couple nights now
[21/03/2021, 15:54:05] ~Talia✨: What did you say to him and do you think he’s failed as a father?
[21/03/2021, 15:54:17] ~Talia✨: Fears of? 
Are you sleeping in the day at least?
[21/03/2021, 15:54:18] Sabrina: It started when I was like
This is super uncomfortable 
When my dads voice started cracking
[21/03/2021, 15:54:40] ~Talia✨: You’re not used to closeness
[21/03/2021, 15:54:52] ~Talia✨: You didn’t grow up around it that’s why you don’t like it
[21/03/2021, 15:55:25] Sabrina: I didn’t know what to say so I just let him talk until he stopped crying cause he doesn’t like it either 
Hence the realisation
[21/03/2021, 15:55:45] ~Talia✨: Do you mean intimacy or vulnerability sis?
[21/03/2021, 15:56:00] Sabrina: Stuff I didn’t realise was eating me up
Like guilt and regret and shit 
Yeah to make up for it
[21/03/2021, 15:56:01] ~Talia✨: Cause in my mind 
Crying is more vulnerability then anything else
[21/03/2021, 15:56:18] ~Talia✨: Guilt about?
[21/03/2021, 15:56:23] Sabrina: I just didn’t know and didn’t want to deal with it
[21/03/2021, 15:56:24] Sabrina: Dude stop
[21/03/2021, 15:56:31] Sabrina: Worry about yourself mahn I’m fine
[21/03/2021, 15:56:33] Sabrina: Get home safe
[21/03/2021, 15:56:35] ~Talia✨: Stop what

[21/03/2021, 15:56:47] ~Talia✨: All I have to do is sit on a plane.
[21/03/2021, 15:56:54] ~Talia✨: I’m not the one not sleeping

[21/03/2021, 15:57:25] Sabrina: But it’s my signature move
[21/03/2021, 15:57:28] Sabrina: Also hypocrite much
[21/03/2021, 15:57:34] Sabrina: You hate confrontation just as much as I do

[21/03/2021, 15:57:42] ~Talia✨: But I’m getting better at it

[21/03/2021, 16:08:09] ~Talia✨: Intimacy or vulnerability?
[21/03/2021, 16:08:16] Sabrina: Fluffy ate a pigeon today and I’m extremely grossed out
[21/03/2021, 16:08:22] ~Talia✨: I don’t care.
[21/03/2021, 16:08:35] Sabrina: If you don’t care about my dog then you don’t care about me
[21/03/2021, 16:08:38] Sabrina: :(
[21/03/2021, 16:08:41] Sabrina: :’(
[21/03/2021, 16:08:52] Sabrina: :’’(
[21/03/2021, 16:08:57] Sabrina: When’s your flight?
[21/03/2021, 16:08:58] ~Talia✨: No I don’t
[21/03/2021, 16:09:02] ~Talia✨: Doesn’t matter.
[21/03/2021, 16:09:09] Sabrina: Fine I’ll google
[21/03/2021, 16:09:20] ~Talia✨: VULNERABILITY OR INTIMACY
[21/03/2021, 16:09:48] Sabrina: Probably 5.30

[21/03/2021, 16:09:54] Sabrina: 45*
[21/03/2021, 16:10:05] Sabrina: What time did you get to the airport ?
[21/03/2021, 16:10:08] ~Talia✨: Just answer the question and I’ll lean you alone
[21/03/2021, 16:10:09] Sabrina: Cause I can work it out
[21/03/2021, 16:10:09] ~Talia✨: Leave
[21/03/2021, 16:10:37] ~Talia✨: One word and I’ll drop it
[21/03/2021, 16:10:54] ~Talia✨: And I’ll ask about fluffy and forget that it happened
[21/03/2021, 16:11:33] Sabrina: Don’t it freaks me out
[21/03/2021, 16:11:38] Sabrina: Feathers everywhere
[21/03/2021, 16:11:48] ~Talia✨: Okay not the point
[21/03/2021, 16:11:59] ~Talia✨: I’ll tell you about tweeds after you answer
[21/03/2021, 16:12:10] Sabrina: It’s probably both
[21/03/2021, 16:12:17] Sabrina: Intimacy cause it’s what I did with pagan
[21/03/2021, 16:12:24] Sabrina: Everyone has vulnerability issues
[21/03/2021, 16:12:29] ~Talia✨: What do you mean?
[21/03/2021, 16:12:48] ~Talia✨: People have a problem with being vulnerable
Seeing other people vulnerable is another thing
[21/03/2021, 16:12:53] Sabrina: Eh it’s a whole thing
Quite cliche
The push people away and ruin everything gambit
[21/03/2021, 16:13:12] Sabrina: Yeah you crying just put me in panic mode
[21/03/2021, 16:13:33] Sabrina: Tweeds!!!
[21/03/2021, 16:13:34] ~Talia✨: Okay we’ll talk about this later
[21/03/2021, 16:13:44] ~Talia✨: It was really freaky for me too
[21/03/2021, 16:14:13] ~Talia✨: He replied to my story 
And like I had 16 DM’s and he’s was the only one I was excited for
[21/03/2021, 16:14:24] ~Talia✨: And they were saying vows and it was low-key deep
[21/03/2021, 16:14:35] Sabrina: Aw
[21/03/2021, 16:14:42] ~Talia✨: Then I started freaking out 
Because if it’s not him I don’t want it
[21/03/2021, 16:15:07] Sabrina: Theres the message I’ve been expecting
[21/03/2021, 16:16:29] ~Talia✨: Kinda ironic
[21/03/2021, 16:16:40] ~Talia✨: It was a coloured and Indian wedding so it was hitting home a lil
[21/03/2021, 16:16:47] Sabrina: A lot of things you do know is ironic so you’ll have to specify
[21/03/2021, 16:16:57] Sabrina: 🥺 hit the feels?
[21/03/2021, 16:17:00] ~Talia✨: I was getting there
[21/03/2021, 16:17:05] ~Talia✨: No 
Freaked me out

[21/03/2021, 16:17:20] Sabrina: Ok I see know
[21/03/2021, 16:17:21] Sabrina: Now
[21/03/2021, 16:17:47] ~Talia✨: yeah
[21/03/2021, 16:17:47] Sabrina: Just remember what Adam said
Most families are like that 
But I know it’ll always bother you
[21/03/2021, 16:17:55] ~Talia✨: I never wanted to be that girl yk
[21/03/2021, 16:18:12] Sabrina: It’s something that’s out of your control and trying to fix it might make it worse
[21/03/2021, 16:18:24] ~Talia✨: I’ve kinda just left it
[21/03/2021, 16:18:39] Sabrina: You’ve got a couple months at the very least
[21/03/2021, 16:18:41] ~Talia✨: Whatever happens happens
[21/03/2021, 16:18:47] Sabrina: That’s the spirit
[21/03/2021, 16:18:50] ~Talia✨: I wanna get it over with
[21/03/2021, 16:19:07] ~Talia✨: He replied to my story 
Hyping me up
[21/03/2021, 16:19:12] ~Talia✨: And it just made my heart melt
[21/03/2021, 16:19:13] Sabrina: Your biggest hype man
[21/03/2021, 16:19:25] Sabrina: Your whole look changed
[21/03/2021, 16:19:28] Sabrina: It was nice
‎[21/03/2021, 16:19:46] ~Talia✨: ‎image omitted
[21/03/2021, 16:19:51] ~Talia✨: Complete 180
[21/03/2021, 16:20:14] Sabrina: Very 🥺
[21/03/2021, 16:20:42] ~Talia✨: If it’s not him
I don’t want it sis
[21/03/2021, 16:20:49] ~Talia✨: After this
I’m done
[21/03/2021, 16:20:57] Sabrina: I have faith
[21/03/2021, 16:21:02] ~Talia✨: I don’t
[21/03/2021, 16:21:10] Sabrina: Which is why i do
[21/03/2021, 16:21:20] ~Talia✨: Yeah fair enough
[21/03/2021, 16:22:12] ~Talia✨: They were saying how’s
[21/03/2021, 16:22:14] ~Talia✨: Vows
[21/03/2021, 16:22:28] ~Talia✨: And the priest goes
When a man finds a wife he finds happened
[21/03/2021, 16:22:41] ~Talia✨: He’s said that proverb to me
[21/03/2021, 16:22:50] ~Talia✨: And I started going into panic mode 
Ngl
[21/03/2021, 16:23:24] Sabrina: Understandable
[21/03/2021, 16:24:15] ~Talia✨: After this I’m done
[21/03/2021, 16:24:38] Sabrina: That’s uhm carries a bit of weight to it
[21/03/2021, 16:25:00] ~Talia✨: Relationships are a lot
[21/03/2021, 16:25:08] ~Talia✨: And the fact that I’d do it all with him is deep.
[21/03/2021, 16:25:17] Sabrina: You don’t say
[21/03/2021, 16:25:27] ~Talia✨: And I don’t think I could do it again
[21/03/2021, 16:25:38] Sabrina: We’ll see what happens
[21/03/2021, 16:25:42] ~Talia✨: We will
[21/03/2021, 16:26:01] ~Talia✨: He just freaks me out when he speaks marriage and kids and shit
[21/03/2021, 16:26:15] Sabrina: As one does yes
[21/03/2021, 16:26:42] ~Talia✨: I just 
Yeah
[21/03/2021, 16:27:06] Sabrina: Do you think you’re ever going to get over this Boulder
[21/03/2021, 16:27:17] ~Talia✨: Which one?
[21/03/2021, 16:27:20] ~Talia✨: You need to specify
[21/03/2021, 16:27:40] Sabrina: There’s only one
[21/03/2021, 16:27:51] Sabrina: That we’re speaking about right now
[21/03/2021, 16:27:57] ~Talia✨: Marriage ?
[21/03/2021, 16:28:10] Sabrina: No this whole
I don’t think I can do it issues
[21/03/2021, 16:28:25] Sabrina: From marriage to kids to all that
[21/03/2021, 16:28:35] ~Talia✨: Oh
[21/03/2021, 16:28:39] ~Talia✨: I can do it
[21/03/2021, 16:28:42] ~Talia✨: It’s not the problem
[21/03/2021, 16:28:50] ~Talia✨: It’s 
Is that what I really want
[21/03/2021, 16:29:10] Sabrina: Your life isn’t set in stone
[21/03/2021, 16:29:34] ~Talia✨: I know
[21/03/2021, 16:29:33] Sabrina: What you want now will differ from what you want in ten years
Or it might not 
You’ve got to wait and see what happens
[21/03/2021, 16:29:45] ~Talia✨: If he never mentioned marriage and kids and shir
[21/03/2021, 16:29:52] ~Talia✨: It would never come out of my mouth
[21/03/2021, 16:29:59] ~Talia✨: I’d never come to you and be like

I’d marry this man
[21/03/2021, 16:30:54] Sabrina: I think what’s preventing you from considering it is the fact that it’s unconventional 
If everyone found the love of their lives and got married and the whole shebang before the age of 18, it would probably be different
[21/03/2021, 16:31:25] ~Talia✨: I refuse to get married before 25.
[21/03/2021, 16:31:25] Sabrina: You’re realistic self isn’t letting you think of these things because you’re resorting to all youve ever known
[21/03/2021, 16:31:42] Sabrina: Why.
[21/03/2021, 16:31:57] ~Talia✨: It’s just 
A huge life decision
[21/03/2021, 16:32:09] ~Talia✨: It’s not even about that
[21/03/2021, 16:32:12] Sabrina: Marriage is a piece of paper that conforms to social norms of other people
[21/03/2021, 16:32:21] ~Talia✨: I just don’t wanna set the expectation too high
[21/03/2021, 16:32:23] Sabrina: Some people never get married but stay together their whole life
[21/03/2021, 16:32:31] ~Talia✨: Marriage is a life long commitment
[21/03/2021, 16:32:33] Sabrina: Because you’ve learnt to not set expectations
[21/03/2021, 16:32:34] ~Talia✨: I’d rather do that
[21/03/2021, 16:32:38] ~Talia✨: Yes
[21/03/2021, 16:32:40] ~Talia✨: And it works
[21/03/2021, 16:32:41] ~Talia✨: Also
[21/03/2021, 16:32:46] Sabrina: Again, stuff you’ve known all your life.
[21/03/2021, 16:32:50] ~Talia✨: Yes
[21/03/2021, 16:32:52] ~Talia✨: I know that
[21/03/2021, 16:32:53] ~Talia✨: But
[21/03/2021, 16:32:54] ~Talia✨: Wow
[21/03/2021, 16:32:55] ~Talia✨: I just
[21/03/2021, 16:32:56] ~Talia✨: Uh
[21/03/2021, 16:33:31] Sabrina: It’s literally the same thing. The only difference is there’s a connotation attached with the word marriage
[21/03/2021, 16:33:57] ~Talia✨: Yeah and marriage is scary
[21/03/2021, 16:34:00] ~Talia✨: I’d actually be a Mrs
[21/03/2021, 16:34:08] ~Talia✨: Not an unofficial one
[21/03/2021, 16:34:12] Sabrina: Marriage is a piece of paper
[21/03/2021, 16:34:23] Sabrina: How you define it is up to yourself and your partner
[21/03/2021, 16:34:27] ~Talia✨: Marriage is the second most legally binding document after death
[21/03/2021, 16:34:50] Sabrina: And is that not a piece of paper
[21/03/2021, 16:34:56] ~Talia✨: Yes.
[21/03/2021, 16:35:00] ~Talia✨: That holds power
[21/03/2021, 16:35:03] ~Talia✨: That’s not the point
[21/03/2021, 16:35:06] Sabrina: Rock beats paper
[21/03/2021, 16:35:09] ~Talia✨: Not before 25 
My mom would say I’m too young
[21/03/2021, 16:35:09] Sabrina: All I’m saying
[21/03/2021, 16:35:20] ~Talia✨: Kids
I just don’t want
[21/03/2021, 16:35:29] ~Talia✨: I don’t want my life to be tied down to kids
[21/03/2021, 16:36:15] Sabrina: If you let your life depend on the opinions of other people you’ll never be able to live for yourself
[21/03/2021, 16:36:22] Sabrina: This is something that some people never get past
[21/03/2021, 16:36:27] ~Talia✨: It’s also my mother
[21/03/2021, 16:36:34] ~Talia✨: And that’s not the point
[21/03/2021, 16:36:42] ~Talia✨: I always wanted to build my own life then settle
[21/03/2021, 16:36:49] ~Talia✨: Not settle then build
[21/03/2021, 16:36:49] Sabrina: There are certain limitations that having kids bring but saying that it ties your down is not the right mindset
[21/03/2021, 16:37:02] ~Talia✨: I don’t want them. 
End of disrespect
[21/03/2021, 16:37:09] ~Talia✨: Discussion*^
[21/03/2021, 16:37:13] Sabrina: There are people who have gone on to get their phd’s while having a two year old puking over their thesis
[21/03/2021, 16:37:23] ~Talia✨: I don’t want them.
[21/03/2021, 16:38:24] Sabrina: Okay
[21/03/2021, 16:38:28] Sabrina: I’m only gonna ask this once
[21/03/2021, 16:39:32] ~Talia✨: Okay taking off now
[21/03/2021, 16:39:34] ~Talia✨: Will answer later
[21/03/2021, 16:39:35] ~Talia✨: Bye

[21/03/2021, 16:39:45] Sabrina: Will I ever be able to get you to have an open mind
Not trying to convince you to have kids or anything that’s a decision you make

[24/03/2021, 17:59:35] ~Talia✨: 😂😂
[24/03/2021, 17:59:49] Sabrina: Idk what that means
[24/03/2021, 18:00:00] ~Talia✨: Remember I told you
[24/03/2021, 18:00:14] ~Talia✨: Indians turn salt when a girl gets lots of attention
[24/03/2021, 18:00:14] Sabrina: Oh oh yes

[24/03/2021, 18:01:25] ~Talia✨: No😂
[24/03/2021, 18:01:37] Sabrina: How can she turn salt for you
[24/03/2021, 18:01:46] Sabrina: The for is throwing me off
[24/03/2021, 18:01:47] ~Talia✨: Wum how

[24/03/2021, 18:01:58] ~Talia✨: She takes salt
[24/03/2021, 18:02:03] ~Talia✨: And makes a circle around me
[24/03/2021, 18:02:12] ~Talia✨: With the salt in her hand
[24/03/2021, 18:02:14] Sabrina: Omg was it a whole ceremony
[24/03/2021, 18:02:20] ~Talia✨: No😂💀
[24/03/2021, 18:02:26] ~Talia✨: She told me to stand up mid episode
[24/03/2021, 18:02:32] ~Talia✨: Quite rude actually
[24/03/2021, 18:02:34] ~Talia✨: Anyways
[24/03/2021, 18:02:37] Sabrina: 😂
[24/03/2021, 18:02:42] ~Talia✨: What’s your opinion on the Camille thing
[24/03/2021, 18:02:46] Sabrina: How modern
Mid episode
[24/03/2021, 18:03:02] Sabrina: I’m not taking sides
[24/03/2021, 18:03:12] ~Talia✨: Didn’t ask you to
[24/03/2021, 18:03:14] Sabrina: I’d like to think of myself as neutral in this situation
[24/03/2021, 18:03:16] Sabrina: What about you
[24/03/2021, 18:03:22] ~Talia✨: Just what you think
[24/03/2021, 18:03:50] ~Talia✨: What josh did wasn’t right in the slightest but she was more upset about it than Troyé was which made it look a lot worse than it was
[24/03/2021, 18:04:08] ~Talia✨: And also bringing Caleb into it wasn’t helping her situation
[24/03/2021, 18:04:10] Sabrina: Yes
[24/03/2021, 18:04:23] ~Talia✨: And her mentioning me and saying I must control him pissed me off slightly
[24/03/2021, 18:04:43] ~Talia✨: And then her saying 
Oh I don’t know how you do it,goodluck 
Really annoyed me
[24/03/2021, 18:04:44] Sabrina: It was rage talk
[24/03/2021, 18:05:20] ~Talia✨: Don’t care 
Don’t bring me into it when you don’t get your way
[24/03/2021, 18:05:33] ~Talia✨: I’m a Mrs not his controller
[24/03/2021, 18:06:07] Sabrina: Okay yes however it’s just a slightly more extreme version of when you say ‘control your mans’ to Otilie
[24/03/2021, 18:06:11] Sabrina: Just for example
[24/03/2021, 18:06:36] ~Talia✨: But mine was never in a serious situation
[24/03/2021, 18:06:52] ~Talia✨: She was like
“Oh yeah speak some sense into him”
[24/03/2021, 18:06:54] Sabrina: Hence the use of the words more extreme
[24/03/2021, 18:07:11] ~Talia✨: Okay fair
[24/03/2021, 18:07:21] Sabrina: Point being I didn’t fixate on that part but I can see why it wasn’t the greatest thing to say
[24/03/2021, 18:07:26] ~Talia✨: Indirectly 
Not direct. Minus
[24/03/2021, 18:08:01] ~Talia✨: I couldn’t give a fuck about the josh thing
Just don’t involve me when you’re not getting your way
[24/03/2021, 18:08:45] Sabrina: She went through a lot today
I just feel bad for her
[24/03/2021, 18:08:59] ~Talia✨: She put herself through a lot
[24/03/2021, 18:09:09] ~Talia✨: No one told her to get involved to that extent
[24/03/2021, 18:09:11] Sabrina: One out of the three things yes
[24/03/2021, 18:09:23] ~Talia✨: What’s the other 2?
[24/03/2021, 18:09:23] Sabrina: I’m just saying
If Caleb was having surgery you’d probably be on edge too
[24/03/2021, 18:09:45] Sabrina: One of the relatives had an attempted suicide
[24/03/2021, 18:09:45] ~Talia✨: Oh yeah 
You probably wouldn’t catch me at school
[24/03/2021, 18:09:52] ~Talia✨: Oof
[24/03/2021, 18:09:53] Sabrina: This information hasn’t been made public yet
[24/03/2021, 18:10:15] Sabrina: Yeah
[24/03/2021, 18:10:50] Sabrina: His surgery lasted about an hour longer than anticipated and she was literally shaking when she came to art

[24/03/2021, 18:11:24] Sabrina: No just overwhelmed
[24/03/2021, 18:11:32] ~Talia✨: Fair enough
[24/03/2021, 18:11:55] Sabrina: Is Josh ok?

[02/04/2021, 16:10:09] ~Talia✨: Been better
[02/04/2021, 16:10:46] Sabrina: Wanna talk about it
[02/04/2021, 16:11:21] ~Talia✨: I understand why he did it and wants
[02/04/2021, 16:11:35] ~Talia✨: What I don’t understand is how he could even speak about pulling other people
[02/04/2021, 16:11:43] ~Talia✨: And that’s the part that baffles me
[02/04/2021, 16:11:50] ~Talia✨: And yeah that’s me
Slightly pissed off.
[02/04/2021, 16:12:02] Sabrina: What happened
[02/04/2021, 16:12:42] ~Talia✨: He just said he feels like it’s getting too serious too quick and that some space would be good so we can work on ourselves and be our own people ahain
[02/04/2021, 16:12:44] ~Talia✨: Again
[02/04/2021, 16:13:14] ~Talia✨: And then as like boundaries and stuff came up 
We talked about pulling other people
[02/04/2021, 16:13:37] ~Talia✨: And I said I was scared that after two weeks he’d come back and say that he prefers the life he has now over what we had
[02/04/2021, 16:13:39] ~Talia✨: And yeah
[02/04/2021, 16:14:30] Sabrina: Did you see this coming?
[02/04/2021, 16:15:05] ~Talia✨: No

I saw the too serious thing coming up because yeah it’s justified
[02/04/2021, 16:15:12] ~Talia✨: I didn’t see the break thing coming up.
[02/04/2021, 16:16:00] Sabrina: Was the break mutually agreed upon?
[02/04/2021, 16:16:08] ~Talia✨: I agreed yeah
[02/04/2021, 16:16:16] ~Talia✨: So it was mutual
[02/04/2021, 16:16:16] Sabrina: So what happens now
[02/04/2021, 16:16:35] ~Talia✨: He said a couple days before my birthday we’ll reevaluate
[02/04/2021, 16:16:51] ~Talia✨: So if my birthday is shitty and ruined then so be it
[02/04/2021, 16:16:58] ~Talia✨: That’s the cards I’ve pulled
[02/04/2021, 16:17:14] Sabrina: I don’t really know what to say
[02/04/2021, 16:17:20] ~Talia✨: Me neither
[02/04/2021, 16:17:52] Sabrina: I’m guessing you’re not gonna go pulling other gents
[02/04/2021, 16:18:06] ~Talia✨: I can’t even look at another man sis
[02/04/2021, 16:18:10] ~Talia✨: If it’s not him it’s no one
[02/04/2021, 16:18:27] ~Talia✨: I’ll stay true to my side
And if he doesn’t
[02/04/2021, 16:18:33] ~Talia✨: I wanna know I played my part
[02/04/2021, 16:18:55] ~Talia✨: That’s all 
I’m a Mrs, till that title is stripped away from me
[02/04/2021, 16:19:06] Sabrina: I don’t understand you two
[02/04/2021, 16:19:14] ~Talia✨: Neither do I
[02/04/2021, 16:19:39] Sabrina: You have a better judgement than me for what’s going on
[02/04/2021, 16:19:46] Sabrina: My door’s always open though
[02/04/2021, 16:19:50] ~Talia✨: I’m not upset about the break
[02/04/2021, 16:19:54] ~Talia✨: I’m really not
[02/04/2021, 16:20:06] Sabrina: You’re not?
[02/04/2021, 16:20:07] ~Talia✨: I’m upset that he could even consider pulling someone else.
[02/04/2021, 16:20:19] ~Talia✨: No I’m not
The break is justified 
It’s understandable
[02/04/2021, 16:20:28] Sabrina: It’s a bit soon
[02/04/2021, 16:20:38] ~Talia✨: What is?
[02/04/2021, 16:20:43] Sabrina: To have a break
[02/04/2021, 16:21:00] Sabrina: It could be that he just needs that confirmation that’s it’s you
[02/04/2021, 16:21:04] Sabrina: That’s one possibility
[02/04/2021, 16:21:15] ~Talia✨: I always had this mindset that solid couples don’t need breaks
[02/04/2021, 16:21:36] ~Talia✨: But we also move VERY fast
[02/04/2021, 16:21:43] Sabrina: It’s always good to have an open mind
[02/04/2021, 16:21:53] ~Talia✨: I’m seeing that
[02/04/2021, 16:22:03] ~Talia✨: If he needs confirmation then it’s not me
[02/04/2021, 16:22:24] Sabrina: Sure
[02/04/2021, 16:22:31] ~Talia✨: You’ve never once heard me say 
Yeah I need to go pull someone else to make sure it’s him
[02/04/2021, 16:22:36] ~Talia✨: Sarcasm?
[02/04/2021, 16:22:55] Sabrina: Some people function differently
[02/04/2021, 16:23:01] ~Talia✨: I known
[02/04/2021, 16:23:03] ~Talia✨: I know
[02/04/2021, 16:23:07] ~Talia✨: But in my mind it’s not me then
[02/04/2021, 16:23:29] Sabrina: No just questionable
[02/04/2021, 16:27:31] ~Talia✨: You always said we move fast
[02/04/2021, 16:28:28] Sabrina: You do

[14/04/2021, 20:26:03] Sabrina: At least
[14/04/2021, 20:26:11] ~Talia✨: Not really in the mood tbh
[14/04/2021, 20:26:27] Sabrina: After that whole ‘I don’t owe you anything’?
[14/04/2021, 20:26:43] ~Talia✨: After the attitude 
And coldness
[14/04/2021, 20:26:48] ~Talia✨: Unprovoked
[14/04/2021, 20:27:06] ~Talia✨: I’m willing to listen to understand why he is like this
[14/04/2021, 20:27:33] ~Talia✨: And I will give him the option to work on things 
But if he says he doesn’t want to 
Then that’s that and I’m done. No going back
[14/04/2021, 20:28:20] Sabrina: Do you think it’s a defence mechanism?
[14/04/2021, 20:28:38] Sabrina: Cause otherwise I don’t know why he’s speaking the way he is
[14/04/2021, 20:28:54] ~Talia✨: It could be
[14/04/2021, 20:28:56] Sabrina: Will he be willing to to explain
[14/04/2021, 20:29:14] ~Talia✨: Idk 
But I want to be able to say that I gave him the opportunity
[14/04/2021, 20:29:20] Sabrina: Stay strong
[14/04/2021, 20:29:30] ~Talia✨: Trying to
[14/04/2021, 20:29:31] Sabrina: He tends to turn things on you
[14/04/2021, 20:29:39] ~Talia✨: Yes I know.
[14/04/2021, 20:29:43] Sabrina: I hope he understands that
[14/04/2021, 20:29:53] ~Talia✨: I hope so too
[14/04/2021, 20:29:56] ~Talia✨: But if not
I tried
[14/04/2021, 20:30:09] Sabrina: How much are you willing to fight for it though
[14/04/2021, 20:30:17] ~Talia✨: I’m not gonna fight
[14/04/2021, 20:30:19] ~Talia✨: And hey
[14/04/2021, 20:30:20] ~Talia✨: Beg
[14/04/2021, 20:30:39] Sabrina: You don’t think it’s worth fighting for?
[14/04/2021, 20:30:39] ~Talia✨: I’m giving him that option 
And if he takes it okay
And if he doesn’t okay
[14/04/2021, 20:30:56] ~Talia✨: I do think it’s worth fighting for 
Not if I’m the only one fighting
[14/04/2021, 20:32:10] Sabrina: I’m a little concerned that intention is gonna be an issue when you guys speak
[14/04/2021, 20:32:28] Sabrina: Cause you not fighting for it could come off as you don’t care enough to
[14/04/2021, 20:32:29] ~Talia✨: Wum intention
[14/04/2021, 20:32:37] ~Talia✨: No
[14/04/2021, 20:32:44] ~Talia✨: I’m willing to listen and work through
[14/04/2021, 20:33:00] ~Talia✨: But if he says 
I’m done Then I won’t beg like I did last time
[14/04/2021, 20:33:11] Sabrina: Yeah I’m just saying when you two are speaking your intention might not be that clear
[14/04/2021, 20:33:23] ~Talia✨: Okay yeah fair
[14/04/2021, 20:33:39] Sabrina: Him saying I’m done might not have conveyed his intended thoughts
[14/04/2021, 20:33:40] Sabrina: Yeah
[14/04/2021, 20:33:44] Sabrina: Lil worried
[14/04/2021, 20:33:56] Sabrina: You know how you like giving him little tests
[14/04/2021, 20:33:56] ~Talia✨: I wanna hear his intended thoughts
[14/04/2021, 20:34:03] Sabrina: What if this is a test
[14/04/2021, 20:34:09] Sabrina: And how he tests you
[14/04/2021, 20:34:17] Sabrina: I hope he tells you
[14/04/2021, 20:34:17] ~Talia✨: This isn’t a test sis
[14/04/2021, 20:34:22] Sabrina: And I hope they come off right
[14/04/2021, 20:34:26] ~Talia✨: And if it 
It’s fucked up

[09/05/2021, 17:12:28] Sabrina: Well you’re a different type but sure
[09/05/2021, 17:12:47] ~Talia✨: He wants to go to CNA when we can just go to clicks grab it on the way out since it’s the same direction as we parked
[09/05/2021, 17:13:03] ~Talia✨: Like what’s the logic there
[09/05/2021, 17:13:13] Sabrina: DUDE I EXPERIENCED THE SAME THING
[09/05/2021, 17:13:36] ~Talia✨: Then he wants to get out the car to open the boot when you can just pull the seat down and grab what he needed from the boot.

[09/05/2021, 17:14:40] Sabrina: No I definitely wouldn’t think that far
[09/05/2021, 17:15:08] Sabrina: He had to get a card for Mother’s Day and his logic was to go to woolies so he could get himself some chicken strips too
[09/05/2021, 17:15:20] Sabrina: You’re just built different ok 😂

[09/05/2021, 17:16:13] ~Talia✨: Okay yeah that makes sense.
[09/05/2021, 17:16:22] Sabrina: But then you gotta move out of the way it seems like a whole spiel
[09/05/2021, 17:16:26] ~Talia✨: Then we were arguing in clicks
[09/05/2021, 17:16:34] ~Talia✨: It was the easiest thing you could do
[09/05/2021, 17:16:38] Sabrina: About what
[09/05/2021, 17:16:46] ~Talia✨: How fast I move
[09/05/2021, 17:17:12] ~Talia✨: He was like why are you in a rush 
And I said I have things to do 
Then he said like what

[11/05/2021, 14:08:35] Sabrina: I think you kinda just have to reassure him sometimes
[11/05/2021, 14:08:46] Sabrina: He really seems like he’s going through a tough time
[11/05/2021, 14:08:53] Sabrina: And everybody likes reassurance

[13/06/2021, 09:49:21] Sabrina: I mean
[13/06/2021, 09:49:24] Sabrina: If worse comes to worse
[13/06/2021, 09:49:28] Sabrina: We’ll figure something out
[13/06/2021, 09:51:31] ~Talia✨: I don’t think he will either
[13/06/2021, 09:51:52] ~Talia✨: I just want one event to be not stressful
[13/06/2021, 09:52:11] ~Talia✨: Everything’s a fight
[13/06/2021, 09:52:25] Sabrina: You’ve already made it this far
[13/06/2021, 09:52:29] Sabrina: Stick it out through the end
[13/06/2021, 09:52:43] ~Talia✨: When’s the end?🙃
[13/06/2021, 09:53:05] Sabrina: I don’t know but hopefully it’ll lesson after school
[13/06/2021, 09:53:14] ~Talia✨: I hope so too
[13/06/2021, 09:53:25] ~Talia✨: Looks like I’m flying to London every couple months
[13/06/2021, 09:53:31] Sabrina: Yay :D
[13/06/2021, 09:54:35] ~Talia✨: At this point I don’t even wanna go
[13/06/2021, 09:54:42] ~Talia✨: It’s become so stressful
[13/06/2021, 09:55:11] Sabrina: Do you think it’s worth it though?
[13/06/2021, 09:55:24] ~Talia✨: The dance 
Or the relationship
[13/06/2021, 09:55:45] Sabrina: Oh lol to the dance sorry I got muddled
[13/06/2021, 09:56:02] Sabrina: If you don’t wanna go then honestly don’t
[13/06/2021, 09:56:08] Sabrina: I know it’s not that easy to say that
[13/06/2021, 09:56:28] ~Talia✨: I do wanna go
[13/06/2021, 09:56:31] Sabrina: But if you can ‘run away’ with him for a night then it’s probably definitely more worth all the hassle and stress it’ll be at the dance
[13/06/2021, 09:56:50] ~Talia✨: It’s like the second most important date in the Talia calendar
[13/06/2021, 09:56:59] ~Talia✨: But it’s not important if he’s not there
[13/06/2021, 09:57:08] Sabrina: Yeah I know
[13/06/2021, 09:57:09] ~Talia✨: That’s my person
[13/06/2021, 09:57:12] Sabrina: And I know that too
[13/06/2021, 09:57:29] Sabrina: But I don’t know what your life is gonna look like in two months
[13/06/2021, 09:57:40] Sabrina: I’ll support you no matter what ☺️
[13/06/2021, 09:58:03] ~Talia✨: I do want to 
But I know if I do 
I’ll be sad the entire night cause he isn’t there 
If I don’t I’ll be sad that I didn’t go 
And I also can’t not go because like I’m deputy head of house.  I can’t not be there.
[13/06/2021, 09:58:23] ~Talia✨: I don’t know what my life will look like tomorrow 
Coco may wipe me out 😂💀
[13/06/2021, 09:58:26] ~Talia✨: Thanks sis
[13/06/2021, 09:58:50] Sabrina: The hype of the dance isn’t all it’s meant to be
You don’t like half the people there and you’ll only fully enjoy it if you get to be there with him
[13/06/2021, 09:59:31] Sabrina: I think that’s the part you’re mentally blocking out is the stigma of the dance
[13/06/2021, 09:59:37] Sabrina: But of course it’s all up to you
[13/06/2021, 09:59:47] ~Talia✨: I know
I don’t like all the people there. But like 5
[13/06/2021, 09:59:58] ~Talia✨: Listen I’d like to go
[13/06/2021, 10:00:10] Sabrina: Plus we can make our own dance
[13/06/2021, 10:00:24] ~Talia✨: But 
At this point 
If I can’t go with him. I won’t even bother
[13/06/2021, 10:00:32] ~Talia✨: I can’t lie to you
[13/06/2021, 10:00:48] ~Talia✨: I wanted the whole cliche Matric dance thing
[13/06/2021, 10:00:56] ~Talia✨: I really did.
[13/06/2021, 10:01:04] Sabrina: Of course
We all did it makes sense
[13/06/2021, 10:01:15] ~Talia✨: And for once I just wanted something normal to happen
[13/06/2021, 10:01:17] ~Talia✨: Yk
[13/06/2021, 10:01:21] ~Talia✨: No complications
[13/06/2021, 10:01:31] Sabrina: If it helps, to some extent, you lost a lot of that when you came to st John’s
[13/06/2021, 10:02:01] Sabrina: Yeah unfortunately life doesn’t like you and it never really works like that in your life
[13/06/2021, 10:02:11] ~Talia✨: Lost a lot of normality?
[13/06/2021, 10:02:20] ~Talia✨: Thanks sis 
Appreciate it😂
[13/06/2021, 10:02:49] Sabrina: Yeah as well as your fantasy matric
The satisfaction of being there with people you grew up with and all the memories of the time at the school
[13/06/2021, 10:02:59] ~Talia✨: Oh yeah that I knew
[13/06/2021, 10:03:26] Sabrina: Just don’t be miserable
[13/06/2021, 10:03:32] ~Talia✨: I’m not miserable
[13/06/2021, 10:03:33] Sabrina: Is usually a good motto to live by
[13/06/2021, 10:03:45] ~Talia✨: I just feel bad for him tbh
[13/06/2021, 10:03:52] Sabrina: You’ll be if you’re there without him
[13/06/2021, 10:04:06] ~Talia✨: I mean 
I guess so
[13/06/2021, 10:04:07] Sabrina: Yeah poor guy
[13/06/2021, 10:04:20] ~Talia✨: And I can’t even do much for him
[13/06/2021, 10:04:28] ~Talia✨: And I can’t help but feel like it’s my fault
[13/06/2021, 10:05:13] Sabrina: Life is a series of choices
[13/06/2021, 10:05:17] Sabrina: You made yours and he made his
[13/06/2021, 10:05:19] Sabrina: Stand by it
[13/06/2021, 10:05:33] ~Talia✨: Did you google that
[13/06/2021, 10:05:40] Sabrina: No it’s what I live by
[13/06/2021, 10:05:50] Sabrina: My philosophy of sorts
[13/06/2021, 10:06:09] Sabrina: The disrespect 😒
[13/06/2021, 10:06:36] ~Talia✨: It’s a valid question
[13/06/2021, 10:06:48] Sabrina: I figured it out a couple years ago and it helps a lot in tough situations
[13/06/2021, 10:06:51] Sabrina: Shuttup
[13/06/2021, 10:07:02] ~Talia✨: Fair enough
[13/06/2021, 10:07:15] ~Talia✨: Wouldn’t be the first
[13/06/2021, 10:07:26] Sabrina: 😂 wow ok I see how it is
[13/06/2021, 10:07:30] Sabrina: Next time I’ll use yahoo
[13/06/2021, 10:07:41] Sabrina: Listen I’m gonna love and leave you now
[13/06/2021, 10:07:45] Sabrina: But also
[13/06/2021, 10:07:47] Sabrina: INCOMING
[13/06/2021, 10:07:49] Sabrina: Also yeah I just wanted to apologise I’m sorry for whatever I’ve been doing for the past few weeks it’s not personal circumstances or anything it’s just what I do when things start working out for me I run away and I wanted to warn you this a few months ago but then I figured no I just won’t do it this time and then the longer time passed the more awkward and scared I became to start up even a conversation again and even now I don’t know what I’m doing. And the whole time I figured you were probably fighting your own demons as well and I wanted to check up on you but I really overthought it and didn’t. I really and truly value your friendship and I’m sorry if I’ve hurt you or made you confused in any way. I’m gonna try be ‘normal’ again if it’s ok with you.
[13/06/2021, 10:09:41] ~Talia✨: Oh gosh
[13/06/2021, 10:09:50] ~Talia✨: Yahoo is great
[13/06/2021, 10:09:56] ~Talia✨: Don’t die driving
[13/06/2021, 10:10:40] ~Talia✨: It’s just what you do when things are working out for you?

[15/06/2021, 07:40:58] ~Talia✨: It’s weird thing 
But I’m glad things are working out
[15/06/2021, 07:41:04] ~Talia✨: I had cookies in my mouth

[17/06/2021, 18:30:55] Sabrina: Went to cinnel today
It’s crazy expensive
[17/06/2021, 18:30:56] Sabrina: Also
[17/06/2021, 18:31:02] Sabrina: How are you and mom and dad doing
[19/06/2021, 20:05:16] Sabrina: Hope you’re ok
[21/06/2021, 18:36:46] Sabrina: I asked Dan
[21/06/2021, 18:36:48] Sabrina: To the dance
[21/06/2021, 18:36:53] Sabrina: Waiting to see what he says
[21/07/2021, 20:13:25] Sabrina: Hey lamb chop 
From the bottom of my heart I hope you’re okay
From the top of my heart I hope mom and dad and Caleb and sparkles are okay too
Signed pork chop
[21/07/2021, 20:29:15] ~Talia✨: Hey, we’re all okay 
I hope you’re good too 

I can’t lie to you and say we’re all good because for a long time I was really upset about how you treated me. I’m very much over it now because I did everything I could. For weeks on end I tried to speak to you, phone you and do everything in between to check on you because I was worried sick. You chose not to respond because things “were going well” for you and that was your decision. Yet when you were ready to speak, you phoned, messaged and everything in between. I didn’t find it fair that when it was convenient for you, we spoke. 
I just needed to know you were okay, I was worried sick. 
I’m not worried about who you spend time with or who you go out with whenever you go out. That’s your own business. 
I just didn’t find what you did fair, especially considering how much time we spent and everything we did together.
[21/07/2021, 22:41:37] Sabrina: ‎You deleted this message.
[21/07/2021, 22:55:54] Sabrina: Okay I’m gonna try this again
I’m sorry. You’re right, this has been incredibly unfair to you and there’s no denying that. I’m not gonna try justify every little thing that happened to me because that’s not what I believe in. But I do hope you’ll understand what I have to say next.

There was a bit of a misunderstanding. When I said ‘things are working out’ I didn’t mean everything else going on in my life. Because all that was actually the opposite. I was talking about us. I’ve never had a friendship becoming as important as the one that was forming between us, and the clearer the realisation the more I panicked. I know it’s completely idiotic but there were times when I would think to myself, “things are going so well that I know im gonna fuck things up. There’s been a bit of a pattern in that area.” But then the next thought would be “just don’t mess up. Talia means everything and just don’t mess up.” And obviously that didn’t pan out.  I’m sorry you interpreted it the way you did, by no means was it intentional. 

Granted the timing wasn’t the greatest on my side, and I know everyone fights demons everyday but I just remembered at the time it felt as it my last string had snapped and I just couldn’t handle it. The good news is that I have my own Tamara now but she gives me happy pills that make me sleepy :)

I screwed up and I’m sorry. I just really tried not to give my baggage to you because I know you had your own baggage to carry so much so that I really really screwed the pooch. I don’t exactly know what happens now, but I hope the sky’s a bit clearer for you now
[21/07/2021, 22:57:16] Sabrina: The whole ‘there’s two sides to every story’ is something I believe in.
I’m glad I got yours and I hope you get mine
[21/07/2021, 22:58:13] Sabrina: Also uh my mom and brother and everyone else in the world doesn’t know about the psychiatrist thing so if you could, please could you keep it between us :)
[22/07/2021, 10:50:33] ~Talia✨: I’ll always try understand. 

I thought everything else was going right and I was so upset because I was there when you were going through it and then when you weren’t. I wasn’t. 
I haven’t had a friendship like this either which is why I was so upset. I was upset for weeks. You were my only genuine friend. 

I just don’t understand why you didn’t come speak to me. Or at least communicate with me in some way. I see you having the time of your life with Kalista and the moment I try to speak to you, you went cold. 

Your very own Tamara. That’s good. 

It’s okay, I just don’t understand why you couldn’t come and speak to me but instead chose to lie to me and tell me everything’s fine when I knew it wasn’t.
[22/07/2021, 10:50:50] ~Talia✨: How’d you end up going if they don’t know you’re going?
[22/07/2021, 17:06:24] Sabrina: I’m not gonna lie to you I did try. Not to tell you everything was going to shit but just to spend time with my friend you know. Went to runge more than a couple times and again timing just wasn’t right. It’s not your fault though, you also had a lot going on. From what I could see and what I knew, which probably wasn’t even the half of it. Also Caleb wasn’t having the time of his life and he was fighting with his parents and it was one of those cases where you couldn’t do much to help him and I was really concerned for the both of you. It’s also beyond unfair to dump my baggage on you when you had all that going on already. Plus, im self sufficient in a almost destructive sense I suppose ☺️  I missed speaking to my friend man. Even if you say you can take it I know in my heart that not telling you would be so much more mentally healthier for you in a sense. That week when you said you couldn’t handle it anymore was scary. I knew at some point there was a bit of a miscommunication between us but I wasn’t in the right mind state to fix everything. Seb used to tell me tales of the chaos Lara went through so I sort of prepared myself for it. The only thing that still weighed on my mind was that you had to go through the past few months ‘alone’ in a sense and I don’t know how you were doing. But anyways
[22/07/2021, 17:07:56] Sabrina: Online meets
[22/07/2021, 17:24:58] ~Talia✨: I did have a lot going on, I always do. Caleb and I have gone through it. But you know what didn’t help, knowing everytime I asked if you were okay you straight up lied to my face saying you were. You were insistent that you were fine. 

I’m also self sufficient, it doesn’t mean you weren’t important or that I wasn’t worried sick. 
You not telling me caused me so much more damage than telling me. I don’t think it’s fair that you decide what’s good for me. 

I know you weren’t in the state of mind to fix it. I forgive you for not fixing it. 
I just want you to know I grieved that loss. 

I was on my own. I am on my own. I’ll probably always be on my own because that’s how life works out for me. I don’t have a friend anymore and it is what it is
[22/07/2021, 17:25:08] ~Talia✨: And paying for it?
[22/07/2021, 17:38:36] Sabrina: The lying was more for myself than it was for you

Regardless, it was a call that I made and I’m sorry if you disagree but I stand by it

I don’t think there’s much I can say to that so if that’s the decision you’ve made then so be it
[22/07/2021, 17:38:47] Sabrina: I’m fairly financially responsible
[22/07/2021, 17:47:46] ~Talia✨: I understand that. I just wish I could’ve been there for you 

You really hurt me. You were my person.
[22/07/2021, 17:47:58] ~Talia✨: Better than me 
That’s for sure
[25/07/2021, 16:38:24] Sabrina: God these are ugly
[25/07/2021, 16:39:35] ~Talia✨: Disgustingly so.
[25/07/2021, 16:40:06] ~Talia✨: I was hoping Michelo or someone would submit something
[25/07/2021, 16:40:10] Sabrina: Why?? I thought Camille would design something
[25/07/2021, 16:40:15] Sabrina: Yeah I thought so too
[25/07/2021, 16:40:17] ~Talia✨: THOSE ARE CAMILLE’s
[25/07/2021, 16:40:26] Sabrina: I had a couple but I figured they’d do better than me
[25/07/2021, 16:40:32] Sabrina: Fuck no
[25/07/2021, 16:40:38] ~Talia✨: Fuck yes
[25/07/2021, 16:42:05] ~Talia✨: Send me your designs
[25/07/2021, 16:48:49] Sabrina: Lemme clean them up a bit

[25/07/2021, 17:22:01] Sabrina: Xander
[25/07/2021, 17:22:15] Sabrina: Ya my brother typed the list lol
[25/07/2021, 17:23:03] ~Talia✨: Xander’s dad is from Holland?
[25/07/2021, 17:23:40] Sabrina: Idk my brother said it
[25/07/2021, 17:24:09] Sabrina: Apparently they talked about it during the Euros when Switzerland beat France
[25/07/2021, 17:24:52] ~Talia✨: I mean sure
[25/07/2021, 19:33:11] Sabrina: Do you have a text list of everyone in our grades’ names?
[25/07/2021, 19:36:37] ~Talia✨: No but George does
[25/07/2021, 21:01:22] Sabrina: Need your opinion of something

[26/07/2021, 08:04:17] Sabrina: Tanks
[26/07/2021, 16:33:42] Sabrina: I was thinking that 
The one with the eagle words is an optional back for any of the other ones I submitted
[26/07/2021, 16:33:57] Sabrina: Cause uno and dos would look bomb together

[26/07/2021, 16:35:15] Sabrina: In my defence
[26/07/2021, 16:35:21] Sabrina: I did add that in the email
[26/07/2021, 16:35:21] ~Talia✨: Let’s see which one makes it through
[26/07/2021, 16:35:28] ~Talia✨: I don’t even wanna hear it😂
[26/07/2021, 16:35:31] Sabrina: Coolsies
[26/07/2021, 16:35:50] ~Talia✨: And then we’ll decide yeah
[26/07/2021, 16:35:57] ~Talia✨: If your design wins it’s becoming your problem
[26/07/2021, 16:36:09] Sabrina: Coolsies
[26/07/2021, 16:36:13] ~Talia✨: Also, Ben pushing you towards me today was not subtle 💀
[26/07/2021, 16:36:22] Sabrina: I KNEW THAT FUCKHEAD WOULD MESS UP
[26/07/2021, 16:36:35] ~Talia✨: Woah
[26/07/2021, 16:36:40] Sabrina: I didn’t say anything to him this whole year until today cause I told him explicitly that I didn’t want the Ben reaction
[26/07/2021, 16:37:04] ~Talia✨: It definitely was a Ben reaction
[26/07/2021, 16:37:03] Sabrina: Also Adam and Caleb ditching the dance?
[26/07/2021, 16:37:14] ~Talia✨: Yk I don’t bite right
[26/07/2021, 16:37:27] Sabrina: I’m guessing you’re almost under obligation to come
[26/07/2021, 16:37:35] ~Talia✨: It’s a long story 
Caleb’s with me though, idk about Adam
[26/07/2021, 16:37:47] Sabrina: Oh that’s good 
The sweetheart debut

[03/10/2021, 18:50:56] Sabrina: Lowkey, fun
[03/10/2021, 18:51:12] Sabrina: Got updated with all the drama going on in a girls school
[03/10/2021, 18:51:14] Sabrina: What about you
[03/10/2021, 18:51:17] Sabrina: Whatcha been up to
[03/10/2021, 19:21:56] ~Talia✨: That’s good
[09/10/2021, 09:40:51] ~Talia✨: When do you guys write Pure 3 and stats 2?
[09/10/2021, 16:33:07] Sabrina: 2 Nov
29 Oct
‎[12/10/2021, 08:57:11] Sabrina: ‎image omitted
[29/10/2021, 09:05:10] ~Talia✨: Can I tell you something
[29/10/2021, 09:05:19] ~Talia✨: Since you’re the only person that’ll understand
[29/10/2021, 11:14:31] Sabrina: Ofc
But I am writing com sci in the afternoon so I’ll possibly only reply after
[29/10/2021, 18:26:58] ~Talia✨: Remember we always talked about the 3 loves thing
[29/10/2021, 18:27:12] ~Talia✨: And how I skipped and whatever
[29/10/2021, 18:27:34] Sabrina: Yeah
[29/10/2021, 18:29:34] ~Talia✨: I’m his 3rd
[29/10/2021, 18:29:38] ~Talia✨: But he’s my second
[29/10/2021, 18:29:46] ~Talia✨: Meaning in theory
[29/10/2021, 18:30:02] ~Talia✨: I’m the love of his life 
But he’s my biggest heartbreak 💀
[29/10/2021, 18:30:08] ~Talia✨: Also how was stats and com sci?
[29/10/2021, 18:30:13] ~Talia✨: Was it AS or A2?
[29/10/2021, 18:30:33] Sabrina: Or
You defy all science and logic as you two seem to have and it works out
[29/10/2021, 18:30:41] Sabrina: But that’s crazy
I’ve never thought about the two not lining up
[29/10/2021, 18:30:58] Sabrina: Both A2
Stats was bit tough
Com Sci was good
[29/10/2021, 18:30:58] ~Talia✨: I didn’t think about till the other day
[29/10/2021, 18:31:09] Sabrina: Maybe you just skipped your second
[29/10/2021, 18:31:16] ~Talia✨: Fuck me. 

Oof
At least com sci was good
[29/10/2021, 18:31:27] ~Talia✨: Nah I think he may be the heartbreak
[29/10/2021, 18:31:37] ~Talia✨: Does it really
[29/10/2021, 18:32:09] Sabrina: What if it’s a metaphorical heartbreak
[29/10/2021, 18:32:20] Sabrina: But also if it’s your heartbreak then surely it would be his too
[29/10/2021, 18:32:37] ~Talia✨: Idk man
[29/10/2021, 18:32:47] ~Talia✨: How can it be more metaphorical
[29/10/2021, 18:33:47] Sabrina: Well I mean
[29/10/2021, 18:33:54] Sabrina: Technically you’ve broken up already
[29/10/2021, 18:34:12] Sabrina: #loophole
[29/10/2021, 18:35:27] ~Talia✨: That’s also true
[29/10/2021, 18:35:38] ~Talia✨: When’s your next paper? 
Maths?
[02/11/2021, 11:31:27] Sabrina: Dude the worst thing happened
[02/11/2021, 11:31:32] Sabrina: My period came in the middle of the exam
[02/11/2021, 12:47:19] ~Talia✨: Oh my.
[02/11/2021, 12:47:23] ~Talia✨: That’s my biggest fear
[02/11/2021, 12:47:26] ~Talia✨: How was maths?
[02/11/2021, 12:57:30] Sabrina: Questions were either really hard or really easy
[02/11/2021, 13:15:22] ~Talia✨: I heard it was tough
[02/11/2021, 13:20:31] Sabrina: Yeah lil bit 💩y
[02/11/2021, 13:20:34] Sabrina: How goes your prep
[02/11/2021, 13:22:04] ~Talia✨: Ugh 
Did you manage to get a pad on though?
[02/11/2021, 13:22:06] ~Talia✨: It goes
[02/11/2021, 13:22:08] ~Talia✨: I’m almost done
[02/11/2021, 13:22:10] ~Talia✨: Which is great
[02/11/2021, 16:38:22] ~Talia✨: YOURE A GOOD PUPPY 
WHATS WRONG WITH YOU💀💀💀
[02/11/2021, 16:58:47] Sabrina: Paraphrased 
But I found it funny
[02/11/2021, 16:58:57] Sabrina: In my defence
It’s where he led the conversation
[02/11/2021, 17:16:32] ~Talia✨: Doesn’t matter 😂😂
[02/11/2021, 17:16:41] ~Talia✨: He already thinks he’s my bitch
[02/11/2021, 17:16:44] ~Talia✨: You just made it worse
[02/11/2021, 17:24:36] Sabrina: He called himself a loyal puppy
[02/11/2021, 17:24:42] Sabrina: Isn’t that endearing
[02/11/2021, 17:33:45] ~Talia✨: The most endearing
[02/11/2021, 17:33:55] ~Talia✨: He is a loyal puppy
[03/11/2021, 15:51:11] ~Talia✨: When’s your next paper?
[03/11/2021, 16:03:06] Sabrina: Fri-yay

[03/11/2021, 19:31:36] Sabrina: I’m guessing you have English?
[03/11/2021, 19:34:11] ~Talia✨: A2?
[03/11/2021, 19:34:16] ~Talia✨: Nice
[03/11/2021, 19:34:19] ~Talia✨: Ah huh
[04/11/2021, 18:28:31] ~Talia✨: Is you ready for com sci
[04/11/2021, 22:48:11] Sabrina: As ready as I’ll ever be I suppose
[04/11/2021, 22:48:15] Sabrina: How you feeling?
[05/11/2021, 05:04:51] ~Talia✨: Tbh this is probably my least prepared for paper
[05/11/2021, 05:05:03] ~Talia✨: But for some reason I still kinda feel good 😂💀
[05/11/2021, 07:50:10] Sabrina: Duuude

[05/11/2021, 11:14:56] Sabrina: How was English
[05/11/2021, 11:20:05] ~Talia✨: Oh my god that’s great
[05/11/2021, 11:20:21] ~Talia✨: It could’ve been way worse
[05/11/2021, 11:34:09] Sabrina: Always great to hear
[05/11/2021, 11:34:27] Sabrina: I feel like this year’s papers were very different from past years
[05/11/2021, 11:34:31] ~Talia✨: I thought so too
[05/11/2021, 11:34:33] Sabrina: You’ve got a bit of a break now right?

‎[05/11/2021, 11:34:58] Sabrina: ‎image omitted
[05/11/2021, 11:35:14] Sabrina: Ecos?

[05/11/2021, 12:14:12] ~Talia✨: What a life
[05/11/2021, 12:58:45] Sabrina: Our roles reversed hehe
[05/11/2021, 13:17:50] ~Talia✨: Definitely
[07/11/2021, 10:15:33] Sabrina: Can I tell you something
[07/11/2021, 10:15:33] Sabrina: Since you’re the only person that’ll understand
[07/11/2021, 10:25:49] ~Talia✨: Yes
[07/11/2021, 10:26:07] ~Talia✨: Why are you forwarding my own messages to me😂😂
[07/11/2021, 15:02:53] Sabrina: Cause it seemed easiest 😁
[07/11/2021, 15:03:29] Sabrina: The divorce is official
[07/11/2021, 15:04:00] Sabrina: And it’s real tense in the house
And my grandpa wants to move away
[07/11/2021, 15:06:21] ~Talia✨: Oh my god
[07/11/2021, 15:06:35] ~Talia✨: Why’s it tense 
And why does he want to move away?
[07/11/2021, 15:06:41] ~Talia✨: Where would he move?
[07/11/2021, 15:07:37] Sabrina: Yeah
He wants to quit his job and move back home
It’s causing a bunch of financial issues 
Seb isn’t handling it well
[07/11/2021, 15:07:47] Sabrina: He’s mad at everyone and wants to go to China
[07/11/2021, 15:08:10] Sabrina: Like screaming fits until 3 in the morning mad
[07/11/2021, 15:08:13] ~Talia✨: Why does he want to quit? 
I can imagine, it’s a loss of income 
Is he not handling it well because of uni?
[07/11/2021, 15:08:22] ~Talia✨: Why’s he mad at everyone?
[07/11/2021, 15:08:27] ~Talia✨: Oh jesus.
[07/11/2021, 15:09:02] Sabrina: He’s been unhappy for years
I’m not too sure about seb, he’s never wanted to discuss it before
But I imagine that’s gotta be part of it
[07/11/2021, 15:09:45] Sabrina: Very traditional guy
Says he’s the ‘man of the household’
Butts head with my dad and thinks my mom is gonna back him but then she didn’t
[07/11/2021, 15:10:02] Sabrina: It was hectic yesterday 
They were throwing rocks around in the house
[07/11/2021, 15:10:14] ~Talia✨: So he wants to just not work? 
It’s hard to discuss things like that though
[07/11/2021, 15:10:38] ~Talia✨: Okay I understand that.
So why don’t they let him move?
[07/11/2021, 15:10:48] ~Talia✨: Rocks? 
My god
[07/11/2021, 15:10:53] Sabrina: Pretty much
My mom says she’s fine with the divorce, but not with the lack of income from his part
[07/11/2021, 15:11:13] ~Talia✨: He can’t just be a stay at home divorced man😂
[07/11/2021, 15:11:38] Sabrina: Cause it’s not that easy
It’s gonna cost about half a mil now just for the plane ticket and quarantine
[07/11/2021, 15:11:52] ~Talia✨: Oh shit
[07/11/2021, 15:11:59] ~Talia✨: I forgot about quarantine and shit
[07/11/2021, 15:12:02] Sabrina: Yeah life’s gone to shit
[07/11/2021, 15:12:08] ~Talia✨: Has someone tried to explain that?
[07/11/2021, 15:12:26] Sabrina: Sort of
[07/11/2021, 15:12:41] Sabrina: That’s why it’s kinda like a maze with no way out right now
[07/11/2021, 15:12:43] ~Talia✨: I can see sis 
Do you need anything? 
Do you need to stay here?
[07/11/2021, 15:13:12] ~Talia✨: Don’t be afraid to alex
[07/11/2021, 15:13:12] Sabrina: Honestly I have no idea what to do 
I need to help my mom
[07/11/2021, 15:13:14] ~Talia✨: Ask*^
[07/11/2021, 15:13:23] ~Talia✨: Help her with?
[07/11/2021, 15:13:41] Sabrina: Anything really
Mainly work
[07/11/2021, 15:13:51] Sabrina: She’s gonna burn out if she hasn’t by now
[07/11/2021, 15:14:13] Sabrina: I realised yesterday, that she works two jobs and teaches for 20 hours a week on top of that
[07/11/2021, 15:14:20] Sabrina: And that’s just for seb
[07/11/2021, 15:14:26] ~Talia✨: Yeah that too
[07/11/2021, 15:14:39] ~Talia✨: Do you want to teach?
[07/11/2021, 15:14:58] Sabrina: Fuck no i hate it 
But yeah I’m gonna have to 😂
[07/11/2021, 15:15:18] ~Talia✨: Oh
[07/11/2021, 15:15:23] ~Talia✨: How was maths btw?
[07/11/2021, 15:15:24] Sabrina: Mom says she’s gonna have to move
[07/11/2021, 15:15:33] ~Talia✨: Tweedledoofus said you didn’t like it
[07/11/2021, 15:15:34] Sabrina: She loves this house so much
[07/11/2021, 15:15:43] Sabrina: Pure 3?
[07/11/2021, 15:15:47] ~Talia✨: She does
[07/11/2021, 15:15:49] ~Talia✨: Yes
[07/11/2021, 15:16:01] ~Talia✨: Yk
[07/11/2021, 15:16:09] Sabrina: He says a lot of things
I walked out fairly happy and he sort of shut that down
[07/11/2021, 15:16:24] Sabrina: It was better than pure 1 😂
[07/11/2021, 15:16:43] ~Talia✨: I think the best thing you can do maybe
Is wait this year and start uni the following year, to give her some time
[07/11/2021, 15:17:08] ~Talia✨: He said after you asked Caroline you came back 
He does say a lot of things. Hurtful things too 

Btw he considered you very impartial
[07/11/2021, 15:17:07] Sabrina: That’s the thing though
Uni is slowly moving out of the picture
[07/11/2021, 15:17:22] ~Talia✨: Wdym slowly moving out? 
Like fully?
[07/11/2021, 15:17:27] ~Talia✨: Really?
[07/11/2021, 15:17:48] Sabrina: Yeah the asking Caroline humbled me 😂
But I still feel good 
Fingers crossed
[07/11/2021, 15:17:57] ~Talia✨: I’m glad sis
[07/11/2021, 15:18:03] Sabrina: It’s a possibility
[07/11/2021, 15:18:05] ~Talia✨: He came home so down😂
[07/11/2021, 15:18:11] ~Talia✨: Mom was trynna comfort him
[07/11/2021, 15:18:17] ~Talia✨: So then what are you gonna do?
[07/11/2021, 15:18:17] Sabrina: Shame but I think he puts a lot of pressure on himself
[07/11/2021, 15:18:21] ~Talia✨: Why don’t you go to SA?
[07/11/2021, 15:18:29] ~Talia✨: Ofc he does
Especially with maths
[07/11/2021, 15:18:38] Sabrina: Yeah I can imagine
[07/11/2021, 15:18:57] Sabrina: No idea
[07/11/2021, 15:19:03] ~Talia✨: He said his A is out the window
[07/11/2021, 15:19:05] Sabrina: Shame man
[07/11/2021, 15:19:14] ~Talia✨: I don’t think mom will let you not go
[07/11/2021, 15:19:14] Sabrina: No he’s underestimating grade boundaries
[07/11/2021, 15:19:29] ~Talia✨: But you know my mom 
She’s horrible at comforting
[07/11/2021, 15:19:32] Sabrina: Cause she feels guilty if I go to wits and seb’s in the uk
[07/11/2021, 15:19:41] Sabrina: So I think her plan is just to make me wait
[07/11/2021, 15:19:49] Sabrina: 😂 it’s sweet that she tried
[07/11/2021, 15:19:52] ~Talia✨: Yeah we have our fingers crossed
[07/11/2021, 15:20:12] ~Talia✨: She didn’t really she kinda she said it’s done, don’t dwell
[07/11/2021, 15:20:37] ~Talia✨: Would you feel mad that he’s going to the UK and you’re in SA?
[07/11/2021, 15:20:38] Sabrina: Well isn’t that just what ya wanna hear
[07/11/2021, 15:20:49] ~Talia✨: Not really
[07/11/2021, 15:20:54] Sabrina: Absolutely not
[07/11/2021, 15:21:00] Sabrina: It’s more of a course issue
[07/11/2021, 15:21:26] ~Talia✨: Why don’t you study com sci?
[07/11/2021, 15:21:33] ~Talia✨: So maybe communicate that with her
[07/11/2021, 15:21:45] Sabrina: Probably will
[07/11/2021, 15:21:50] ~Talia✨: That’ you’re comfortable with staying in SA
[07/11/2021, 15:22:18] ~Talia✨: And she shouldn’t feel guilty that he’s in the UK
And that you’re happy that at least Seb gets to be there
[07/11/2021, 15:22:44] Sabrina: It’s gonna be irregardless of what I say though
[07/11/2021, 15:22:46] Sabrina: Part of it at least
[07/11/2021, 15:23:14] ~Talia✨: No I understand that
[07/11/2021, 15:23:17] ~Talia✨: But at least voice it
[07/11/2021, 15:23:23] ~Talia✨: Don’t assume it won’t have any impact
[07/11/2021, 15:23:30] Sabrina: Honestly seeing everyone in your family cry is something else
[07/11/2021, 15:23:30] ~Talia✨: Just so it’s out there
[07/11/2021, 15:23:40] Sabrina: My dad’s making briyani 😂
[07/11/2021, 15:23:40] ~Talia✨: I know sis
[07/11/2021, 15:23:45] Sabrina: Said he felt like it
[07/11/2021, 15:23:44] ~Talia✨: I’ve been there
[07/11/2021, 15:23:54] Sabrina: He’s injured too
[07/11/2021, 15:23:50] ~Talia✨: Wow😂
[07/11/2021, 15:24:00] Sabrina: It sucks man
[07/11/2021, 15:23:59] ~Talia✨: What happened?
[07/11/2021, 15:24:08] ~Talia✨: God this is such a shitshow
[07/11/2021, 15:24:37] ~Talia✨: I know it does sis 
You sure you don’t need anything?
Want me to Uber eats you something?
[07/11/2021, 15:24:39] Sabrina: Third degree burns on his legs and foot
[07/11/2021, 15:24:48] Sabrina: He’s at home until it heals
[07/11/2021, 15:25:06] Sabrina: And all just because I’m done with school
[07/11/2021, 15:25:22] Sabrina: I think I’m good
I don’t know what to do with myself 😂
[07/11/2021, 15:25:47] ~Talia✨: What the fuck
[07/11/2021, 15:25:48] Sabrina: Thanks though
For sharing my load
[07/11/2021, 15:25:51] ~Talia✨: How’d that happen
[07/11/2021, 15:25:53] ~Talia✨: Always
[07/11/2021, 15:25:57] ~Talia✨: You share mine
[07/11/2021, 15:26:05] ~Talia✨: You sure
[07/11/2021, 15:26:16] Sabrina: Its the third time since he’s worked there
[07/11/2021, 15:26:24] ~Talia✨: Definitely a bittersweet moment
[07/11/2021, 15:26:28] ~Talia✨: My god
[07/11/2021, 15:26:36] Sabrina: He didn’t specify but the machines he works with are really hot
[07/11/2021, 15:26:44] Sabrina: So I’m assuming human error
[07/11/2021, 15:26:50] ~Talia✨: I would assume so
[07/11/2021, 15:26:59] ~Talia✨: Yk I’m always here right
[07/11/2021, 15:26:59] Sabrina: So what ya up to
[07/11/2021, 15:27:04] Sabrina: Thanks man
[07/11/2021, 15:27:12] ~Talia✨: Well I took these two days off
[07/11/2021, 15:27:19] Sabrina: I literally told everyone else that i’m offline for the next couple days
[07/11/2021, 15:27:22] Sabrina: Nice
[07/11/2021, 15:27:27] Sabrina: Me-to-me days
[07/11/2021, 15:27:36] ~Talia✨: Me to me time is great
[07/11/2021, 15:27:41] ~Talia✨: Went to Sandton today with dad
[07/11/2021, 15:27:42] Sabrina: Even though I’m sorta bombarding this one 😂
[07/11/2021, 15:27:53] ~Talia✨: Wdym?
[07/11/2021, 15:27:55] Sabrina: Aw
[07/11/2021, 15:28:02] Sabrina: Didya buy anything pretty
[07/11/2021, 15:28:20] ~Talia✨: I got a dress! 
And it was really pretty
[07/11/2021, 15:28:23] ~Talia✨: And cheap too
[07/11/2021, 15:28:31] Sabrina: Nice!!
[07/11/2021, 15:28:33] ~Talia✨: I’m also very sad recently
[07/11/2021, 15:28:33] Sabrina: Fancy dress?
[07/11/2021, 15:28:36] Sabrina: Oh no
[07/11/2021, 15:28:40] Sabrina: Why?
[07/11/2021, 15:28:43] ~Talia✨: Sort of but not too fancy
[07/11/2021, 15:28:54] ~Talia✨: I feel very disconnected from everything
[07/11/2021, 15:28:59] ~Talia✨: And I’m very emotional
[07/11/2021, 15:29:17] ~Talia✨: And Tweedledoofus has just said some horrible stuff over the last couple days
[07/11/2021, 15:29:24] Sabrina: Dude exam mood swings are such a thing 
I don’t know if you get it too
[07/11/2021, 15:29:24] ~Talia✨: So I’m working on not taking it personally
[07/11/2021, 15:29:31] ~Talia✨: Yes. I do
[07/11/2021, 15:29:38] Sabrina: What a bitch 😠
[07/11/2021, 15:29:41] ~Talia✨: So yeah 
I’m really sad
[07/11/2021, 15:29:44] Sabrina: Yeah try to
[07/11/2021, 15:29:53] Sabrina: Gah damnit
[07/11/2021, 15:29:58] Sabrina: Talking to Tamara?
[07/11/2021, 15:30:04] ~Talia✨: He said I should be grateful he chose me but he isn’t grateful I chose him because he’s everyone’s first choice anyway
[07/11/2021, 15:30:10] ~Talia✨: Yes 
A lot
[07/11/2021, 15:30:17] ~Talia✨: I cried in therapy this week
[07/11/2021, 15:30:26] Sabrina: Oof 
That choice of words
I do not like them
[07/11/2021, 15:30:45] Sabrina: God it’s whole new issues now
[07/11/2021, 15:30:49] ~Talia✨: He doesn’t realise what he says 
And I said go ask someone you consider impartial and see if they see a problem with that
[07/11/2021, 15:30:53] Sabrina: I sorta hoped they’d simmer down after high school
[07/11/2021, 15:31:00] ~Talia✨: Me too
[07/11/2021, 15:31:25] ~Talia✨: I also told him I’m tired of hearing about his past lifestyle and I hate when he spends 45 mins talking about himself
[07/11/2021, 15:31:25] Sabrina: Ugh
[07/11/2021, 15:31:35] ~Talia✨: Which he labeled as you
[07/11/2021, 15:31:58] Sabrina: Is part of this him being tense from exams?
[07/11/2021, 15:32:03] Sabrina: Not that it justifies it of course
[07/11/2021, 15:32:08] Sabrina: Oh no no no no no
[07/11/2021, 15:32:08] ~Talia✨: No he’s just always been like that
[07/11/2021, 15:32:11] ~Talia✨: Yk him
[07/11/2021, 15:32:18] ~Talia✨: He loves to talk about himself.
[07/11/2021, 15:32:23] Sabrina: I was really hoping there was another reason
[07/11/2021, 15:32:36] ~Talia✨: Yeah which I found great because any rational person would agree that what he said was fucked up.
[07/11/2021, 15:32:48] Sabrina: What are you gonna do?
[07/11/2021, 15:32:58] Sabrina: Did you tell him off?
[07/11/2021, 15:33:11] ~Talia✨: I was basically screaming
[07/11/2021, 15:33:15] ~Talia✨: I did
[07/11/2021, 15:33:19] Sabrina: Good on you
[07/11/2021, 15:33:20] ~Talia✨: But I was just so hurt Yk
[07/11/2021, 15:33:24] ~Talia✨: He made me sound so less than him
[07/11/2021, 15:33:27] ~Talia✨: And honestly
[07/11/2021, 15:33:30] ~Talia✨: He’s lucky to have me.
[07/11/2021, 15:33:30] Sabrina: Yeah ofc it’s a terrible thing to say
[07/11/2021, 15:33:35] Sabrina: That’s the thing though
[07/11/2021, 15:33:37] Sabrina: That’s exactly it
[07/11/2021, 15:33:41] ~Talia✨: I’m a flex of a girlfriend
[07/11/2021, 15:33:49] Sabrina: He’s got some sort of superiority complex and it’s annoying
[07/11/2021, 15:34:00] ~Talia✨: Like he doesn’t realise that because I’m not blonde with blue eyes
[07/11/2021, 15:34:09] ~Talia✨: It’s such a terrible thing
[07/11/2021, 15:34:13] ~Talia✨: But I also know it’s not true
[07/11/2021, 15:34:24] ~Talia✨: Because he should be fucking grateful that I chose him
[07/11/2021, 15:34:29] ~Talia✨: And continue to choose him.
[07/11/2021, 15:34:38] Sabrina: And you shouldn’t have to tell him that for him to know
[07/11/2021, 15:34:50] ~Talia✨: Giving
[07/11/2021, 15:34:53] ~Talia✨: Right*^^
[07/11/2021, 15:35:00] Sabrina: I’m sorry
[07/11/2021, 15:35:01] ~Talia✨: You agree with me?
[07/11/2021, 15:35:10] Sabrina: No shit 😂
[07/11/2021, 15:35:19] ~Talia✨: I appreciate it
[07/11/2021, 15:35:28] ~Talia✨: I’m going to be real ugly rn
[07/11/2021, 15:35:31] Sabrina: What kind of person says ‘you should be grateful’
[07/11/2021, 15:35:30] ~Talia✨: But it’s you
[07/11/2021, 15:35:34] ~Talia✨: So I know it’s confidential
[07/11/2021, 15:35:39] Sabrina: Yeah always
[07/11/2021, 15:35:46] ~Talia✨: But I took the fuckboy
[07/11/2021, 15:35:52] ~Talia✨: Dealt with his whored
[07/11/2021, 15:35:55] ~Talia✨: Whores
[07/11/2021, 15:36:04] ~Talia✨: I was literally dragged through the mud
[07/11/2021, 15:36:14] ~Talia✨: Called horrible names by his parents
[07/11/2021, 15:36:28] ~Talia✨: Dealt with him being emotionally unavailable
[07/11/2021, 15:36:42] ~Talia✨: Dealt with his ego which makes me feel like there’s 3 people in the relationship
[07/11/2021, 15:36:49] ~Talia✨: Dealt with his shitty as fuck friends
[07/11/2021, 15:36:55] ~Talia✨: BUT I MUST BE GRATEFUL?
[07/11/2021, 15:36:59] ~Talia✨: He does
[07/11/2021, 15:37:10] Sabrina: Is it still worth it?
[07/11/2021, 15:37:16] ~Talia✨: I would’ve been okay if he said I’m grateful you chose me too. 
That’s different
[07/11/2021, 15:37:33] Sabrina: Yeah it would be
[07/11/2021, 15:37:36] ~Talia✨: Rn tbh 
No. 
Nothing is worth feeling less than what you are
[07/11/2021, 15:37:53] ~Talia✨: But I also know I’m the flex between us yk
[07/11/2021, 15:37:58] Sabrina: Do you think in the long run it’ll be worth it?
[07/11/2021, 15:38:12] Sabrina: No kidding
[07/11/2021, 15:38:16] ~Talia✨: If he comes around yes
[07/11/2021, 15:38:19] ~Talia✨: You’re bias.
[07/11/2021, 15:38:29] ~Talia✨: If he doesn’t
Then he might have to do this on his own
[07/11/2021, 15:38:34] Sabrina: I’ve been dubbed impartial 😁
[07/11/2021, 15:38:44] ~Talia✨: I value myself enough to not be taken for less than him.
[07/11/2021, 15:38:44] Sabrina: How long has it been?
[07/11/2021, 15:38:53] ~Talia✨: It’s always been like this sis
[07/11/2021, 15:39:01] ~Talia✨: Yeah but still
[07/11/2021, 15:39:03] ~Talia✨: In general
[07/11/2021, 15:39:08] Sabrina: Just always remember that
[07/11/2021, 15:39:11] ~Talia✨: I honestly think people like me more
[07/11/2021, 15:39:22] Sabrina: But you said he doesn’t realise he’s wrong?
[07/11/2021, 15:39:25] ~Talia✨: Not huns because all they wanna do is fuck him
[07/11/2021, 15:39:28] ~Talia✨: No he doesn’t.
[07/11/2021, 15:39:32] ~Talia✨: He saw no problem with it
[07/11/2021, 15:39:33] Sabrina: Again
No kidding 😂
[07/11/2021, 15:39:46] ~Talia✨: No he’s convinced people don’t like me and think I’m a brat
[07/11/2021, 15:39:57] ~Talia✨: He says everyone likes him more
[07/11/2021, 15:39:57] Sabrina: How fucking ironic
[07/11/2021, 15:40:05] ~Talia✨: I mean right.
[07/11/2021, 15:40:21] ~Talia✨: But no one can tell him shit
And he was like people love hearing about me
[07/11/2021, 15:40:28] ~Talia✨: It’s different if it’s one conversation
[07/11/2021, 15:40:34] Sabrina: Why the fuck should it even matter though
[07/11/2021, 15:40:36] ~Talia✨: When every fucking day you hear the same thing it’s not.
[07/11/2021, 15:40:51] Sabrina: Yeah it gets real annoying real quick
[07/11/2021, 15:41:04] ~Talia✨: It doesn’t
He just loves to point out that I’m ungrateful and full of attitude.
[07/11/2021, 15:41:10] ~Talia✨: He doesn’t realise that
[07/11/2021, 15:41:24] Sabrina: Do you think he’ll come around?
[07/11/2021, 15:41:43] ~Talia✨: I need to speak to him when his walls are down
[07/11/2021, 15:42:24] ~Talia✨: We had such a raw and open conversation a couple weeks back and I just feel like we moved 10 steps forward
[07/11/2021, 15:42:27] ~Talia✨: It was so eye opening
[07/11/2021, 15:42:39] Sabrina: Aw progress!
[07/11/2021, 15:42:47] Sabrina: Development
[07/11/2021, 15:42:47] ~Talia✨: But then his walls went back up
[07/11/2021, 15:42:52] ~Talia✨: So it was counterproductive
[07/11/2021, 15:43:00] ~Talia✨: But I learnt a lot from that one conversation
[07/11/2021, 15:43:13] ~Talia✨: I’m hoping to catch him on the 20th when we sleepover
[07/11/2021, 15:43:27] Sabrina: I know you’ve waited a really long time already but I think things will get better after high school
[07/11/2021, 15:43:39] ~Talia✨: I saw a glimpse of hope Yk
[07/11/2021, 15:43:47] ~Talia✨: And that’s what makes me stick around
[07/11/2021, 15:43:53] ~Talia✨: It always gets better
[07/11/2021, 15:43:56] Sabrina: I think there’s hope
[07/11/2021, 15:44:05] Sabrina: I think if anyone has any chance of changing him it’s you
[07/11/2021, 15:44:06] ~Talia✨: I just don’t know how long I can take it
[07/11/2021, 15:44:16] ~Talia✨: He’s so just self centered
[07/11/2021, 15:44:24] ~Talia✨: I feel like it’s my feelings vs his ego
[07/11/2021, 15:44:40] Sabrina: Honestly it’s been this since the start
[07/11/2021, 15:44:46] ~Talia✨: Exactly
[07/11/2021, 15:44:49] ~Talia✨: Yk
[07/11/2021, 15:44:52] ~Talia✨: The hardest part is
[07/11/2021, 15:45:01] ~Talia✨: I got an apology for this not long ago
[07/11/2021, 15:45:06] ~Talia✨: And it’s just the same shit
[07/11/2021, 15:45:15] ~Talia✨: Another ugly comment
[07/11/2021, 15:45:44] ~Talia✨: I think I’m one of the only people capable of dealing with him on such an intimate level
But he’s not the only man capable of dealing with me.
[07/11/2021, 15:46:01] Sabrina: At least his apologies are sincere (I think) even if he retracts into his old ways
[07/11/2021, 15:46:05] ~Talia✨: “I’ve been doing some deep thinking and tbh I don’t like the person I’ve become. I’m not gonna tell you that you deserve better but instead I wanna become better to deserve you. I’m sorry for all my ego and arrogance has put you through and I’m gonna try my best to change. Thanks for putting up with all my shit and once again I’m sorry for upsetting you”
[07/11/2021, 15:46:28] ~Talia✨: They are
 He just never apologises
I have to kick and scream 95% of the time
[07/11/2021, 15:46:40] Sabrina: That’s fair
[07/11/2021, 15:46:40] ~Talia✨: Sis 
He can’t take criticism 
He gets so pissed off
[07/11/2021, 15:47:08] Sabrina: As long as it’s still worth it
[07/11/2021, 15:47:26] ~Talia✨: In this very moment
It isn’t.
[07/11/2021, 15:47:38] ~Talia✨: So yeah
[07/11/2021, 15:47:45] Sabrina: Again, if anyone has shot of changing him, it’s you 
It kinda sucks , and it’s extremely unfair on you , but it’s what it is
[07/11/2021, 15:47:59] ~Talia✨: I’m not crazy for feeling how I feel right
[07/11/2021, 15:48:03] Sabrina: Honest question
Would you ever give up on him?
[07/11/2021, 15:48:07] Sabrina: Not at all
[07/11/2021, 15:48:24] ~Talia✨: Like I’m not being unreasonable by saying I’m tired of hearing him speak about himself
[07/11/2021, 15:48:24] Sabrina: I don’t how you’re putting up with it and I dont know how you’ve been putting up with it for so long
[07/11/2021, 15:48:39] ~Talia✨: And then I said you never ask me anything
And he goes “oh I didn’t know you needed a therapist”
[07/11/2021, 15:49:01] Sabrina: And honestly sometimes the relationship isn’t healthy at all but when I ask you if it’s worth it you’ve stuck by the answer yes so I’ve backed off
[07/11/2021, 15:49:21] ~Talia✨: I’ve been very close to 
I don’t think I mentally could
But I think he might take Everything from me and I have no choice but to
[07/11/2021, 15:49:28] Sabrina: Oh go
[07/11/2021, 15:49:30] Sabrina: God
[07/11/2021, 15:49:41] ~Talia✨: I don’t know either tbh
[07/11/2021, 15:49:48] ~Talia✨: I’m honestly built different
[07/11/2021, 15:49:54] Sabrina: I don’t blame you
[07/11/2021, 15:49:55] ~Talia✨: And I don’t know if it’s because I’m strong or weak
[07/11/2021, 15:50:06] Sabrina: It’s a valid question
[07/11/2021, 15:50:16] ~Talia✨: Yeah but I’m questioning that worth now
[07/11/2021, 15:50:22] ~Talia✨: What does he give me anymore?
[07/11/2021, 15:50:27] ~Talia✨: Genuinely and truly
[07/11/2021, 15:50:29] Sabrina: Do you think he’s capable of change?
[07/11/2021, 15:50:40] ~Talia✨: I think he’s capable of it
Because I’ve seen it
[07/11/2021, 15:50:46] Sabrina: That You’ve got to answer for yourself
[07/11/2021, 15:50:47] ~Talia✨: I just don’t know when he’ll realise that
[07/11/2021, 15:50:53] ~Talia✨: I don’t know
[07/11/2021, 15:51:15] Sabrina: And the shitty thing is
No matter how many times other people tell him, he has to realise it for himself
[07/11/2021, 15:51:17] ~Talia✨: These past 2-3 weeks I just feel so drained
[07/11/2021, 15:51:23] ~Talia✨: That’s the thing
[07/11/2021, 15:51:43] Sabrina: Comfort ? Love? Support ?
[07/11/2021, 15:51:44] ~Talia✨: And the one person that actually criticises him 
He can’t take that criticism
[07/11/2021, 15:52:21] Sabrina: He’s been coddled since god knows how long and you might just be the first person who’s slapped him in the face with reality and still stuck around after that
[07/11/2021, 15:52:45] ~Talia✨: Comfort he isn’t compassionate which I’ve recently learnt 
Love, yes always. But a lot of people can give me love 
Support, yes but like I’ve said. Many people in my life have given me support
[07/11/2021, 15:52:50] ~Talia✨: Yk what the worst thing is
[07/11/2021, 15:53:02] ~Talia✨: I think Adam has given me more emotional support than Caleb has
[07/11/2021, 15:53:11] Sabrina: Oofie
[07/11/2021, 15:53:14] ~Talia✨: And he hates it
He loses his shit with me
[07/11/2021, 15:53:20] Sabrina: Well that’s not great to hear
[07/11/2021, 15:53:22] ~Talia✨: HUGE oofie
[07/11/2021, 15:53:27] ~Talia✨: How pathetic
[07/11/2021, 15:53:42] Sabrina: I hate that he makes you cry
[07/11/2021, 15:54:01] ~Talia✨: Yk how many times I’ve sobbed
[07/11/2021, 15:54:09] ~Talia✨: I sobbed for an entire night about 2 weeks ago
[07/11/2021, 15:54:18] Sabrina: I don’t think anyone deserves your tears
[07/11/2021, 15:54:23] Sabrina: And yet it happens over and over again
[07/11/2021, 15:54:30] ~Talia✨: I’m gonna be honest with you. I love you but I always end up hurting you. I’m not the type of person you should be in a relationship with because I can’t give you what you need. My mindset has done nothing but harm to you and everything we’ve tried to build. I would call you but I know it wouldn’t help. It’s with a heavy heart that I suggest I should take my exit. If we don’t speak again I want you to know that you were my everything and I’ll always have love for you.
[07/11/2021, 15:54:53] ~Talia✨: You need to stop doing this to yourself. Holding on is hurting you more than letting go. I’m not good for you and I can’t give you what you want from a man. I don’t wanna keep hurting you cause everytime I do it eats away at me too much and soon there’s gonna be nothing left. If I take my exit I know you’ll be better off eventually, maybe not now but you’ll learn to live without me
[07/11/2021, 15:54:53] ~Talia✨: You’ll be better off in the sense that you won’t get hurt and you life will be a lot less emotional. 

You were always good enough, I don’t want to leave you, I want you to stop getting hurt and in order for me to do that I probably have to step out
[07/11/2021, 15:55:03] ~Talia✨: I didn’t think so either
[07/11/2021, 15:55:07] ~Talia✨: Yet here I am
[07/11/2021, 15:55:12] ~Talia✨: But then again 
I did cry over you too
[07/11/2021, 15:55:19] ~Talia✨: It’s horrible
[07/11/2021, 15:55:48] Sabrina: Damn
[07/11/2021, 15:55:55] Sabrina: So nothing’s changed since April
[07/11/2021, 15:56:03] ~Talia✨: Nope
[07/11/2021, 15:56:06] ~Talia✨: Doesn’t look like it
[07/11/2021, 15:56:10] ~Talia✨: Kinda sad huh
[07/11/2021, 15:56:14] Sabrina: Yeah
[07/11/2021, 15:56:16] Sabrina: Just a lil
[07/11/2021, 15:56:20] ~Talia✨: Maybe he isn’t built for this lifestyle
[07/11/2021, 15:56:21] Sabrina: It’s a sobering reality
[07/11/2021, 15:56:28] ~Talia✨: And I need to recognise that
[07/11/2021, 15:56:41] Sabrina: The question is if you’d still like to stick around
[07/11/2021, 15:57:03] Sabrina: And find out
[07/11/2021, 15:57:04] ~Talia✨: Yk how they say don’t fall in love with potential
[07/11/2021, 15:57:28] Sabrina: Yeah
‘Don’t fall in love with someone you think you can change.’
[07/11/2021, 15:57:42] ~Talia✨: I don’t know if I fell in love with potential or if I fell in love with the man that I see when hes guard isn’t up
[07/11/2021, 15:57:46] Sabrina: ‘Take them for who they are or don’t take them at all’
[07/11/2021, 15:58:02] Sabrina: It’s definitely different when his walks are down
[07/11/2021, 15:58:16] ~Talia✨: Because the man I see when he doesn’t have his guard up 
I kid you not
I fall in love over and over again. Every singel time
[07/11/2021, 15:58:19] ~Talia✨: Single**
[07/11/2021, 15:58:26] ~Talia✨: I took him for what he is
[07/11/2021, 15:58:36] ~Talia✨: But I never thought he was so harsh
[07/11/2021, 15:58:40] ~Talia✨: You know Tamara said to me
[07/11/2021, 15:58:48] ~Talia✨: He’s very very harsh on you Talia
[07/11/2021, 15:58:55] ~Talia✨: And he gaslights me
[07/11/2021, 15:59:17] Sabrina: Damn
I didn’t know she’d actually say it
[07/11/2021, 15:59:20] Sabrina: So, so much
[07/11/2021, 15:59:29] Sabrina: Ever since I learnt what gaslighting was
[07/11/2021, 16:00:08] ~Talia✨: Yk one point
[07/11/2021, 16:00:13] ~Talia✨: I literally asked myself
Am I crazy
[07/11/2021, 16:00:21] ~Talia✨: No she said it
[07/11/2021, 16:00:25] ~Talia✨: With her full chest
[07/11/2021, 16:00:46] Sabrina: How did you respond
[07/11/2021, 16:01:16] ~Talia✨: I said I didn’t know if I was being sensitive
[07/11/2021, 16:01:37] ~Talia✨: I’ve learnt that I can’t depend on him for a lot of things
[07/11/2021, 16:01:46] ~Talia✨: And I’m too sensitive
[07/11/2021, 16:02:29] ~Talia✨: Yk I cried for this message. 
I literally sobbed
[07/11/2021, 16:02:44] ~Talia✨: And Yk what hurts me the most
[07/11/2021, 16:03:00] ~Talia✨: He’s aware of what he does
[07/11/2021, 16:03:06] ~Talia✨: And he knows how I feel
[07/11/2021, 16:03:18] ~Talia✨: Yet instead of trying to be the man I need 
He’d rather leave
[07/11/2021, 16:03:50] ~Talia✨: And he says he doesn’t wanna change because then he’s changing who he is for me and all I do is complain and I’m ungrateful
[07/11/2021, 16:04:12] Sabrina: Do you want to break up?
[07/11/2021, 16:04:25] ~Talia✨: He’s got a hold on me sis
[07/11/2021, 16:04:29] ~Talia✨: Idk what it is
[07/11/2021, 16:04:47] ~Talia✨: But I will always gravitate towards him
[07/11/2021, 16:05:01] ~Talia✨: But idk if it’s because I gravitate towards broken people
[07/11/2021, 16:05:09] ~Talia✨: Or emotionally unattached people
[07/11/2021, 16:05:14] ~Talia✨: Tamara said he’s like my dad
[07/11/2021, 16:05:19] Sabrina: You know that rose quote
[07/11/2021, 16:05:42] ~Talia✨: Which one
[07/11/2021, 16:05:48] Sabrina: I’m paraphrasing but something along the lines of 
‘She stayed for the rose but got hurt by the thorns each time’
[07/11/2021, 16:05:55] Sabrina: Oof
[07/11/2021, 16:05:57] Sabrina: Ouch
[07/11/2021, 16:05:59] Sabrina: Daddy issues
[07/11/2021, 16:06:06] ~Talia✨: Oh I’ve never seen it
[07/11/2021, 16:06:21] ~Talia✨: Yk people naturally gravitate to partners that resemble their parents
[07/11/2021, 16:06:25] Sabrina: Yeah
[07/11/2021, 16:06:34] ~Talia✨: He gravitates towards me because I remind of his mom
[07/11/2021, 16:06:51] ~Talia✨: He doesn’t know that’s why I have the hold on him
[07/11/2021, 16:06:56] ~Talia✨: And I’m not gonna tell him
[07/11/2021, 16:07:04] ~Talia✨: But yeah that’s why he’s so fond of me
[07/11/2021, 16:07:15] Sabrina: Maybe this all will work out
[07/11/2021, 16:07:18] Sabrina: There is some hope
[07/11/2021, 16:07:45] ~Talia✨: Yk
[07/11/2021, 16:07:47] ~Talia✨: If it doesn’t
[07/11/2021, 16:07:53] ~Talia✨: I can’t say I didn’t give it everything I had
[07/11/2021, 16:08:14] ~Talia✨: A rational person would leave before they have nothing left
[07/11/2021, 16:08:26] ~Talia✨: But I think I wanna know I gave it everything I had
[08/11/2021, 17:10:49] ~Talia✨: I was just thinking of you 
And I can’t really put myself in your shoes but I do want you to know that I’m here for you and I love you. Like always 


If you need anything, please tell me. And if you wanna go for some brownies or pizza in sparkles we can totally do that. I just want you to know you’re not alone
[09/11/2021, 09:41:32] Sabrina: It means so so much. Really. Thank you.
[09/11/2021, 09:41:48] Sabrina: I’ll definitely take you up on your offer sometime
[09/11/2021, 18:00:19] ~Talia✨: You know I got you 
Always
[09/11/2021, 18:00:23] ~Talia✨: Please do!
[09/11/2021, 18:03:21] ~Talia✨: I remember why I do this
[15/11/2021, 08:55:19] ~Talia✨: What do you want for your birthday
[15/11/2021, 08:55:30] ~Talia✨: Don’t say nothing
[15/11/2021, 19:44:36] Sabrina: I want happiness for everyone :-D
[15/11/2021, 19:48:39] ~Talia✨: I also can’t do that.
[15/11/2021, 19:49:43] Sabrina: Well gosh darn it
[15/11/2021, 19:49:50] Sabrina: What to do what to do
[15/11/2021, 19:56:11] ~Talia✨: What do you need
[15/11/2021, 19:56:26] ~Talia✨: I can’t compile a list like last year because we haven’t spent time together
[15/11/2021, 19:59:11] Sabrina: Very fair
[15/11/2021, 20:00:20] ~Talia✨: Exactly
[15/11/2021, 20:00:21] ~Talia✨: So
[15/11/2021, 20:00:23] Sabrina: I’m consulting my brain
[15/11/2021, 20:00:25] ~Talia✨: What do you think you need
[15/11/2021, 20:00:28] ~Talia✨: Or want
[15/11/2021, 20:00:32] ~Talia✨: What food can I buy you
[15/11/2021, 20:00:42] ~Talia✨: Can I take you for really really yummy sushi
[15/11/2021, 20:00:50] Sabrina: 😱😱😱
[15/11/2021, 20:00:52] Sabrina: Omg
[15/11/2021, 20:00:58] Sabrina: Let’s !!!!!!!!!!!!!
[15/11/2021, 20:01:01] ~Talia✨: Also, I forgot about Adam’s birthday and I felt bad
[15/11/2021, 20:01:09] ~Talia✨: But then i didn’t feel bad because he didn’t wish me either
[15/11/2021, 20:01:27] Sabrina: I debated wishing him happy birthday 
But since I’m out of high school there’s no chance we’re keeping in contact
So I didn’t bother
[15/11/2021, 20:01:32] Sabrina: Yeah don’t
[15/11/2021, 20:01:38] ~Talia✨: That’s also fair
[15/11/2021, 20:01:42] ~Talia✨: Definitely
[15/11/2021, 20:01:47] ~Talia✨: You tell me when and we can go :)
[15/11/2021, 20:01:50] Sabrina: You have little to no affiliation to him anymore I think
[15/11/2021, 20:01:53] ~Talia✨: Have you been to big mouth?
[15/11/2021, 20:02:11] ~Talia✨: Uhm until I spend like 4 days straight with him in Kynsna for Caleb’s birthday
[15/11/2021, 20:02:23] Sabrina: Maybe day before or after? Or week of?
Seb’s gonna be home and I think dad wants to take us out for lunch on the day
[15/11/2021, 20:02:25] Sabrina: Not for sushi
[15/11/2021, 20:02:36] Sabrina: Oh damn is he going too??
[15/11/2021, 20:02:37] ~Talia✨: Completely up to you
[15/11/2021, 20:02:53] ~Talia✨: Yeah he’s going with Caleb 
So he’ll be there for a couple weeks
[15/11/2021, 20:03:07] ~Talia✨: Okay well we’re going!
[15/11/2021, 20:03:14] Sabrina: Fun
[15/11/2021, 20:03:22] Sabrina: Bonding time
[15/11/2021, 20:03:38] ~Talia✨: I mean considering Caleb called Adam a two faced snake
Sure.
[15/11/2021, 20:03:55] Sabrina: Yeah I’m a little confused about the nature of their relationship
[15/11/2021, 20:03:59] ~Talia✨: Me too
[15/11/2021, 20:04:04] ~Talia✨: But I don’t question it
[15/11/2021, 20:04:11] Sabrina: As long as they’re happy
[15/11/2021, 20:04:21] ~Talia✨: Idk if they are
[15/11/2021, 20:04:35] Sabrina: As long as they think they’re happy
[15/11/2021, 20:04:50] ~Talia✨: Is Caleb ever happy Is the true question
[15/11/2021, 20:04:57] ~Talia✨: Have you finished racking your brain
[15/11/2021, 20:06:07] Sabrina: Deep stuff man
[15/11/2021, 20:06:54] Sabrina: Oh I thought the spending time together was the gift
[15/11/2021, 20:06:58] Sabrina: I’m very happy with that
[15/11/2021, 20:10:00] ~Talia✨: I just leave it
[15/11/2021, 20:10:04] ~Talia✨: I mean ofc always
[15/11/2021, 20:10:13] ~Talia✨: But is there anything you need slash want
[16/11/2021, 20:24:28] Sabrina: You know me

[05/02/2022, 16:51:31] Sabrina: It’s really just
[05/02/2022, 16:51:33] Sabrina: Big big sigh
[05/02/2022, 16:51:34] ~Talia✨: Then complains about going
[05/02/2022, 16:51:36] ~Talia✨: Like
Huh
[05/02/2022, 16:51:40] Sabrina: And he goes back and he craps about it

[05/02/2022, 16:51:51] ~Talia✨: EXACTLY

[05/02/2022, 16:52:18] ~Talia✨: and after he goes out
He’s always like, it was alright… woulda rather spent it with tou
[05/02/2022, 16:52:37] Sabrina: I don’t think anything’s ever going to change unless you say something
[05/02/2022, 16:52:52] ~Talia✨: I don’t care enough to say anything 😂😂
[05/02/2022, 16:53:07] Sabrina: This low expectations thing is working out great 😂
[05/02/2022, 16:53:15] ~Talia✨: Ikr
[05/02/2022, 16:53:17] ~Talia✨: It’s great
[05/02/2022, 16:53:19] ~Talia✨: I love it
[05/02/2022, 16:53:34] ~Talia✨: Not everyone holds friendship to a high standard
[05/02/2022, 16:53:55] ~Talia✨: And let’s be honest 
He just wants someone to party with
[05/02/2022, 16:53:58] Sabrina: Yeah
[05/02/2022, 16:54:02] ~Talia✨: It’s for convenience
[05/02/2022, 16:54:04] Sabrina: At least you know
[05/02/2022, 16:54:11] ~Talia✨: Even though he’s hypocritical
[05/02/2022, 16:54:19] ~Talia✨: He just wants a clubbing buddy
[05/02/2022, 16:55:01] ~Talia✨: And he’s buying me dessert today
[05/02/2022, 16:55:06] ~Talia✨: So I’ll take it
[05/02/2022, 16:55:13] Sabrina: Free meal
[05/02/2022, 16:55:17] Sabrina: Nice 😂
[05/02/2022, 16:55:27] Sabrina: As long as you’re profiting and not the opposite
[05/02/2022, 16:55:40] ~Talia✨: And whiskey!
[05/02/2022, 16:55:56] ~Talia✨: I refuse to worry about things I can’t control
[05/02/2022, 16:56:20] Sabrina: 😂😂😂
[05/02/2022, 16:56:23] Sabrina: Living it up
[05/02/2022, 16:56:27] ~Talia✨: And even more importantly things that don’t affect me
[05/02/2022, 16:57:02] Sabrina: That’s so much character development compared to two years ago
[05/02/2022, 16:57:07] Sabrina: Good for you
[05/02/2022, 16:57:12] ~Talia✨: I know right!!!!

[05/02/2022, 16:58:17] ~Talia✨: I got an email for Amsterdam yesterday
[05/02/2022, 16:58:28] ~Talia✨: Thanks 😂
One of the only perks
[05/02/2022, 16:58:48] Sabrina: And?
[05/02/2022, 16:59:04] ~Talia✨: They were missing a document
[05/02/2022, 16:59:09] ~Talia✨: But I had a heart attack
[05/02/2022, 16:59:16] Sabrina: They didn’t accept my transcript
[05/02/2022, 16:59:19] ~Talia✨: And then I was like woah
It’s happening
[05/02/2022, 16:59:33] ~Talia✨: The one you asked from Portia?
[05/02/2022, 16:59:41] Sabrina: Yup
[05/02/2022, 16:59:51] Sabrina: And after I got it certified outside
[05/02/2022, 17:00:04] Sabrina: All sorted?
[05/02/2022, 17:01:42] ~Talia✨: He
[05/02/2022, 17:01:45] ~Talia✨: Yes tbink so
[05/02/2022, 17:01:50] ~Talia✨: Woah
[05/02/2022, 17:01:52] ~Talia✨: That’s odd
[05/02/2022, 17:02:04] ~Talia✨: Why didn’t they accept 
The Hague didn’t accept Caleb’s either
[05/02/2022, 17:02:17] Sabrina: Eh I still have time
[05/02/2022, 17:02:21] Sabrina: Weird though right
[05/02/2022, 17:02:27] ~Talia✨: What did they say?
[05/02/2022, 17:03:22] Sabrina: And then they sent me this
‎[05/02/2022, 17:03:25] Sabrina: ‎image omitted
[05/02/2022, 17:04:13] ~Talia✨: Oh but you didn’t do GCSE’s before that

Thanks
[05/02/2022, 17:04:36] ~Talia✨: We could have classes together!!!!
[05/02/2022, 17:04:40] Sabrina: Thought might as well take a chance
[05/02/2022, 17:04:43] Sabrina: Really???!!!!
[05/02/2022, 17:04:47] ~Talia✨: Yesssssss
[05/02/2022, 17:04:52] Sabrina: Yay!!!!!
[05/02/2022, 17:05:25] ~Talia✨: You should

[05/02/2022, 17:09:09] ~Talia✨: Wait
[05/02/2022, 17:09:15] ~Talia✨: Did you log into your student email?
[05/02/2022, 17:09:29] Sabrina: Think so
[05/02/2022, 17:09:34] Sabrina: Not really though
[05/02/2022, 17:09:51] ~Talia✨: Huh
[05/02/2022, 17:09:52] ~Talia✨: Wdym
[05/02/2022, 17:10:03] ~Talia✨: Your email says your login
[05/02/2022, 17:10:07] ~Talia✨: I’m confuzzled
[05/02/2022, 18:04:15] Sabrina: My UVA login I think
[05/02/2022, 18:04:18] Sabrina: I haven’t checked it out yet
[05/02/2022, 21:09:51] ~Talia✨: Ugh
[05/02/2022, 21:09:54] ~Talia✨: I hate men

[06/02/2022, 10:35:08] Sabrina: Is he okay 😂
[06/02/2022, 10:35:13] Sabrina: First and foremost
[06/02/2022, 10:35:33] ~Talia✨: Oh 
He was shaken up
[06/02/2022, 10:35:45] ~Talia✨: Caleb phoned me at like 11 
Asking to come by
[06/02/2022, 10:35:51] ~Talia✨: He was just like wtf just happened
[06/02/2022, 10:35:55] ~Talia✨: Yes he does
[07/02/2022, 13:57:29] ~Talia✨: Need to vent again
[07/02/2022, 13:57:30] ~Talia✨: Pissed.
[07/02/2022, 13:58:14] Sabrina: Go ahead
[07/02/2022, 13:58:30] ~Talia✨: Josh kissed Mille without her consent
[07/02/2022, 13:58:36] ~Talia✨: Huge fight broke out at the club
[07/02/2022, 13:58:40] Sabrina: Oh no
[07/02/2022, 13:58:43] Sabrina: No no no
[07/02/2022, 13:58:49] ~Talia✨: Which is why josh got into fight
[07/02/2022, 13:58:51] Sabrina: That’s harassment
[07/02/2022, 13:58:54] ~Talia✨: Caleb’s all disappointed
[07/02/2022, 13:58:56] Sabrina: No no no no no
[07/02/2022, 13:59:03] ~Talia✨: Yesterday night fight
[07/02/2022, 13:59:04] ~Talia✨: Right
[07/02/2022, 13:59:13] ~Talia✨: Oh 
I didn’t think he was capable
Of that
[07/02/2022, 13:59:16] ~Talia✨: What what what
[07/02/2022, 13:59:27] ~Talia✨: Don’t know if I can associate with him anymore
[07/02/2022, 13:59:32] ~Talia✨: What what what
[07/02/2022, 13:59:37] ~Talia✨: Poof
[07/02/2022, 13:59:46] ~Talia✨: Going to Josh’s birthday thing
[07/02/2022, 13:59:53] ~Talia✨: I genuinely am disgusted
[07/02/2022, 14:00:21] Sabrina: I’m sorry but sexual harassment is my non negotiable line
[07/02/2022, 14:00:28] ~Talia✨: That’s what I’m saying
[07/02/2022, 14:00:33] ~Talia✨: It’s also my non negotiable
[07/02/2022, 14:00:36] ~Talia✨: Like it’s the start
[07/02/2022, 14:00:49] ~Talia✨: How could you possibly associate with someone that does shit like that
[07/02/2022, 14:00:52] ~Talia✨: I’m so pissed
[07/02/2022, 14:00:59] Sabrina: No this is a cut off all ties for me
[07/02/2022, 14:01:03] Sabrina: Regardless of who
[07/02/2022, 14:01:06] Sabrina: God no
[07/02/2022, 14:01:08] ~Talia✨: As in with Josh
[07/02/2022, 14:01:12] Sabrina: Yeah
[07/02/2022, 14:01:16] ~Talia✨: Because I’m mad at Caleb
[07/02/2022, 14:01:28] Sabrina: Caleb’s letting it slide?
[07/02/2022, 14:01:33] ~Talia✨: Pissed actually
[07/02/2022, 14:01:37] ~Talia✨: I don’t know
[07/02/2022, 14:01:45] Sabrina: You have every right
[07/02/2022, 14:01:57] Sabrina: I’m sorry
[07/02/2022, 14:02:28] ~Talia✨: I just can’t
[07/02/2022, 14:02:32] ~Talia✨: I’m genuinely so upset
[07/02/2022, 14:02:34] ~Talia✨: So so upset
[07/02/2022, 14:02:51] ~Talia✨: I don’t know if I can date a man that is apologetic to this
[07/02/2022, 14:03:13] Sabrina: You’re gonna have to consider everything
[07/02/2022, 14:03:33] Sabrina: Maybe try talk to him first?
I wanna give him the benefit of the doubt
Somehow
[07/02/2022, 14:04:04] ~Talia✨: Consider what
[07/02/2022, 14:04:11] ~Talia✨: That could’ve been me
[07/02/2022, 14:04:11] Sabrina: Oh his
[07/02/2022, 14:04:15] Sabrina: This*
[07/02/2022, 14:04:27] Sabrina: 1 in 3 hey
[07/02/2022, 14:04:34] ~Talia✨: I’ll express how disgusted I am
[07/02/2022, 14:04:45] Sabrina: This one’s bad
[07/02/2022, 14:04:57] ~Talia✨: Wdym
Bad
[07/02/2022, 14:05:22] Sabrina: Josh did something bad
Caleb’s not doing something great either
[07/02/2022, 14:05:32] ~Talia✨: Yeah
[07/02/2022, 14:05:46] Sabrina: Maybe Caleb will come around
[07/02/2022, 14:05:52] ~Talia✨: I’m genuinely so disappointed in the fact you still choose to associate with Josh knowing what he did
[07/02/2022, 14:05:56] ~Talia✨: That’s what I wanna say
[07/02/2022, 14:06:08] Sabrina: It’s basically saying he’s letting it slide
[07/02/2022, 14:06:14] ~Talia✨: Exactly
[07/02/2022, 14:06:23] Sabrina: Like josh needs to learn consequences
[07/02/2022, 14:06:32] Sabrina: And this isn’t it
[07/02/2022, 14:06:40] ~Talia✨: Is that okay
[07/02/2022, 14:07:03] Sabrina: It seems a bit of an understatement but it’s definitely a good start
[07/02/2022, 14:07:10] ~Talia✨: What should I say
[07/02/2022, 14:07:15] Sabrina: No no start with that
[07/02/2022, 14:07:19] Sabrina: See how he responds
[07/02/2022, 14:07:22] ~Talia✨: And then what
[07/02/2022, 14:07:25] Sabrina: Does he know that it’s a big deal
[07/02/2022, 14:07:29] ~Talia✨: Idk
[07/02/2022, 14:07:32] ~Talia✨: We’ll find out
[07/02/2022, 14:07:49] Sabrina: Idk if he’s gonna dismiss it
[07/02/2022, 14:07:54] Sabrina: It’s a sensitive topic
[07/02/2022, 14:07:54] ~Talia✨: Probably
[07/02/2022, 14:08:02] ~Talia✨: It’s very sensitive
[07/02/2022, 14:08:15] ~Talia✨: How can I start a women’s forum when my own boyfriend is an apologist
[07/02/2022, 14:08:20] Sabrina: The ‘what if it were me’ is a big card
[07/02/2022, 14:08:36] ~Talia✨: Yeah and the answer was “I’d probably kill him0
[07/02/2022, 14:08:49] ~Talia✨: So you can imagine my disbelief
[07/02/2022, 14:08:51] Sabrina: Then????
[07/02/2022, 14:08:56] ~Talia✨: Exactly
[07/02/2022, 14:09:02] ~Talia✨: I’m so upset
[07/02/2022, 14:09:17] Sabrina: I just
[07/02/2022, 14:09:26] Sabrina: It’s my line
[07/02/2022, 14:09:31] ~Talia✨: It’s mine too
[07/02/2022, 14:09:54] ~Talia✨: I’m beyond upset
[07/02/2022, 14:09:56] Sabrina: Hopefully he’ll understand
[07/02/2022, 14:10:02] Sabrina: It hits home
[07/02/2022, 14:10:26] ~Talia✨: What’s there to not understand
[07/02/2022, 14:10:33] Sabrina: I don’t know
[07/02/2022, 14:10:39] ~Talia✨: Exactly
[07/02/2022, 14:10:40] Sabrina: Im really trying to give him the benefit of the doubt
[07/02/2022, 14:10:46] ~Talia✨: I can’t
[07/02/2022, 14:10:49] ~Talia✨: I’m sorry I can’t
[07/02/2022, 14:11:03] Sabrina: Like I don’t want this to be the reason of a break up
[07/02/2022, 14:11:07] Sabrina: Worse case scenario speaking
[07/02/2022, 14:11:19] Sabrina: So im just banking of faith that he’ll come around
[07/02/2022, 14:12:04] ~Talia✨: It could be mine
[07/02/2022, 14:12:03] Sabrina: Is Millie okay
[07/02/2022, 14:12:09] ~Talia✨: It genuinely could be mine
[07/02/2022, 14:12:22] Sabrina: and I completely respect that
[07/02/2022, 14:12:24] ~Talia✨: Idk
Seems like she encouraged the fight
[07/02/2022, 14:12:46] Sabrina: Hum
[07/02/2022, 14:12:50] Sabrina: Uhm *
[07/02/2022, 14:14:06] ~Talia✨: Tbh
[07/02/2022, 14:14:22] ~Talia✨: I wouldn’t be mad if someone fucked up a guy because of that
[07/02/2022, 14:14:42] Sabrina: Oh yeah same
[07/02/2022, 14:14:57] ~Talia✨: I just
[07/02/2022, 14:14:57] ~Talia✨: Wow
[07/02/2022, 14:15:53] ~Talia✨: I wanna say to him that we probably need to have a talk because I don’t know if I can date a man that will knowingly associate with a man that has done such after claiming how he would never touch a woman and brotherhood in the college
Etc
[07/02/2022, 14:16:17] Sabrina: I was really hoping you’d say that
[07/02/2022, 14:16:26] Sabrina: Like I didn’t wanna push it
[07/02/2022, 14:16:26] ~Talia✨: Yeah well
[07/02/2022, 14:16:32] ~Talia✨: No it’s true
[07/02/2022, 14:16:40] Sabrina: But yeah that’s definitely needed
[07/02/2022, 14:16:44] ~Talia✨: I just
[07/02/2022, 14:16:45] ~Talia✨: Wow
[07/02/2022, 14:16:58] Sabrina: Like if seb did this
[07/02/2022, 14:17:25] ~Talia✨: I have such an urge to speak to Adam
[07/02/2022, 14:17:29] ~Talia✨: But obviously I can’t
[07/02/2022, 14:17:42] Sabrina: Oh actually Adam would’ve been a great ally
[07/02/2022, 14:18:23] ~Talia✨: Adam will probably still associate
[07/02/2022, 14:18:45] ~Talia✨: For the sake of partying
[07/02/2022, 14:20:00] ~Talia✨: I literally feel sick to my stomach
[07/02/2022, 14:20:08] ~Talia✨: I’m not even being dramatic
[07/02/2022, 14:20:13] Sabrina: No I know
[07/02/2022, 14:20:18] ~Talia✨: I just wow
[07/02/2022, 14:33:54] ~Talia✨: And shit hit the fan
[07/02/2022, 14:33:57] ~Talia✨: He replied ok
[07/02/2022, 14:38:16] Sabrina: It’s a step
[07/02/2022, 14:39:14] ~Talia✨: He just replied ok
[07/02/2022, 14:39:19] ~Talia✨: How is that a step
[07/02/2022, 14:39:31] Sabrina: Doesn’t it mean he’s open to talk?
[07/02/2022, 14:39:52] Sabrina: Or at the very least open to listen
[07/02/2022, 14:41:44] ~Talia✨: No
[07/02/2022, 14:41:52] ~Talia✨: He meant it passive aggressively
[07/02/2022, 14:41:58] ~Talia✨: Like he doesn’t care
[07/02/2022, 14:42:47] Sabrina: it’s better than
‘What’s there to talk about’ or something
[07/02/2022, 14:42:49] Sabrina: Idk
[07/02/2022, 14:42:51] Sabrina: Good luck
[07/02/2022, 14:42:58] ~Talia✨: I’m not replying
[07/02/2022, 14:43:14] Sabrina: Still gonna talk to him)
[07/02/2022, 14:43:15] Sabrina: ?*
[07/02/2022, 14:43:24] ~Talia✨: Maybe tomorrow
[07/02/2022, 14:43:48] ~Talia✨: Not in the mood now
[07/02/2022, 14:43:52] Sabrina: Hope for the best
[07/02/2022, 14:43:59] Sabrina: Yeah I wouldn’t be either
[07/02/2022, 14:44:01] ~Talia✨: What do I even say to “ok”
[07/02/2022, 14:44:23] Sabrina: Well I would go with 
Wtf is wrong with you 

But that’s just me
[07/02/2022, 14:44:37] ~Talia✨: Yeah I thought about going with that too
[07/02/2022, 14:44:48] Sabrina: It would be nice wouldn’t it
[07/02/2022, 14:44:49] ~Talia✨: But that won’t achieve anything
[07/02/2022, 14:44:59] Sabrina: But I just don’t want him to think you’re biased by emotion or something
[07/02/2022, 14:45:18] Sabrina: Like losing your temper propably won’t help your case with him
[07/02/2022, 14:46:25] ~Talia✨: I’m just gonna say then we’re probably gonna need to have a talk on Wednesday then
[07/02/2022, 14:46:38] Sabrina: Whenever you’re ready
[07/02/2022, 14:46:44] ~Talia✨: I think so
[07/02/2022, 14:47:48] ~Talia✨: I said 
“If that’s how you wanna handle this situation. We’re gonna need to talk on Wednesday”
[07/02/2022, 14:48:06] Sabrina: I think that’s better than anything I would’ve said
[07/02/2022, 14:48:20] ~Talia✨: You’re bias
[07/02/2022, 14:48:27] Sabrina: I’m pissed
[07/02/2022, 14:48:35] ~Talia✨: Maybe he’ll realise how serious I am
[07/02/2022, 14:48:48] Sabrina: Hopefully
[07/02/2022, 14:49:33] Sabrina: I’m just making sure the facts are straight
You’re confident josh did what he did?
[07/02/2022, 14:50:00] ~Talia✨: Yes
[07/02/2022, 14:50:03] ~Talia✨: Caleb is too
[07/02/2022, 14:50:06] ~Talia✨: He saw the messages
[07/02/2022, 14:50:17] ~Talia✨: We both stood there in shock knowing it actually happened
[07/02/2022, 14:50:31] Sabrina: Excuse my language but
[07/02/2022, 14:50:35] Sabrina: Fucking hell
[07/02/2022, 14:51:01] ~Talia✨: Yes
[07/02/2022, 14:51:02] ~Talia✨: Exactly
[07/02/2022, 14:51:32] ~Talia✨: Like it’s not just an accusation
[07/02/2022, 14:51:38] ~Talia✨: there’s proof
[07/02/2022, 14:51:44] ~Talia✨: Caleb knows it happens
[07/02/2022, 14:52:04] ~Talia✨: Happened*^
[07/02/2022, 14:52:17] Sabrina: And you saw him react the way he did?
[07/02/2022, 14:53:12] ~Talia✨: I saw him after he found out
[07/02/2022, 14:53:15] ~Talia✨: He was shook it happened
[07/02/2022, 14:53:30] ~Talia✨: Couldn’t believe josh did it, I said I always knew he was capable of such
[07/02/2022, 14:54:00] Sabrina: Him being capable is one thing
Him actually doing it is another
[07/02/2022, 14:54:08] ~Talia✨: Yeah and he did
[07/02/2022, 14:54:16] ~Talia✨: And he was going on about college brotherhood
[07/02/2022, 14:54:19] ~Talia✨: And whatever
[07/02/2022, 14:54:37] Sabrina: I have no words
[07/02/2022, 14:55:08] ~Talia✨: Completely disgusted
[07/02/2022, 14:55:11] ~Talia✨: Hurt
[07/02/2022, 14:55:12] ~Talia✨: Emotional
[07/02/2022, 14:55:30] ~Talia✨: Wow
[07/02/2022, 14:55:33] Sabrina: And pissed
[07/02/2022, 14:55:39] Sabrina: Flat out pissed
[07/02/2022, 14:55:44] ~Talia✨: Yes
[07/02/2022, 14:55:47] ~Talia✨: Ugh
[07/02/2022, 14:56:18] ~Talia✨: I knew we had different views on a lot of things
[07/02/2022, 14:56:40] ~Talia✨: But I didn’t think this would be one of them
[07/02/2022, 14:57:08] Sabrina: If this isn’t his line, what is
[07/02/2022, 14:57:10] Sabrina: Besides you
[07/02/2022, 14:57:20] ~Talia✨: Wdym
[07/02/2022, 14:57:50] Sabrina: If anything happened to you, without question he’d do what he had to
[07/02/2022, 14:57:56] ~Talia✨: Yeah
[07/02/2022, 14:58:05] ~Talia✨: But he had no problem associating
[07/02/2022, 14:58:21] ~Talia✨: With someone that would do it
[07/02/2022, 14:58:29] Sabrina: That’s what I mean
[07/02/2022, 14:58:32] Sabrina: What’s his line
[07/02/2022, 14:59:01] ~Talia✨: Who knows
[07/02/2022, 15:00:17] ~Talia✨: And tbh
[07/02/2022, 15:00:20] ~Talia✨: Do I even wanna know
[07/02/2022, 15:14:23] Sabrina: Are you willing to let him let this slide?
[07/02/2022, 15:14:36] ~Talia✨: No
‎[07/02/2022, 15:14:42] ~Talia✨: ‎image omitted
[07/02/2022, 15:16:01] Sabrina: I wish you all the best
[07/02/2022, 15:20:06] ~Talia✨: You don’t even have to call
I’ll be straight up with you.
If you’re going to go around with Josh and still be besties with someone that kissed someone without consent whilst saying you’d kill someone if that happened to me. I genuinely don’t know if I can date someone that is apologetic to those types of behaviors. Especially after the conversation we’ve had about abuse and how against it you were. I’ve been in very close situations over the years and if my own boyfriend can still knowingly  choose to associate with a man that can do such. I’m not really sure what to do or say. 

On the other, I could be blowing this out of proportion and you could be going for other reasons. If I am blowing it out of proportion I’m more than willing to drop this.
[07/02/2022, 15:20:08] ~Talia✨: Boom
[07/02/2022, 15:20:47] Sabrina: Stellar
[07/02/2022, 15:21:44] ~Talia✨: Thank you
[07/02/2022, 16:37:58] ~Talia✨: I fucked up
[07/02/2022, 16:38:04] ~Talia✨: He was going to reprimand him
[07/02/2022, 16:38:12] ~Talia✨: And I accused him of all these things
[07/02/2022, 16:38:22] ~Talia✨: Now he’s pissed
[07/02/2022, 16:38:32] ~Talia✨: I think he broke up with me
[07/02/2022, 19:27:41] Sabrina: Are you okay?
[08/02/2022, 07:57:07] ~Talia✨: Not sure tbh
[08/02/2022, 07:58:07] ~Talia✨: Kinda just letting it play out
[08/02/2022, 09:46:55] Sabrina: I don’t think either of you are completely in the wrong
[08/02/2022, 09:54:02] ~Talia✨: I just jumped to conclusions
[08/02/2022, 09:55:50] Sabrina: Tbf you only did that because he didn’t do anything to suggest that he was going to do anything
[08/02/2022, 09:57:30] ~Talia✨: And be said he’s not answerable to me and I should’ve given him the decency to ask
[08/02/2022, 09:57:55] Sabrina: He said reprimand though
[08/02/2022, 10:36:34] ~Talia✨: Wdym
[08/02/2022, 10:45:34] Sabrina: We both would’ve cut off all ties without question
[08/02/2022, 10:45:49] Sabrina: This feels a bit like settling
[08/02/2022, 15:27:17] ~Talia✨: Yeah he said they wanted him to admit it to his face and then they are never gonna talk to him again
[08/02/2022, 15:27:25] ~Talia✨: I feel like shit
[08/02/2022, 15:27:32] ~Talia✨: I assumed the worst from him
[08/02/2022, 15:27:44] ~Talia✨: But yet I also feel deep in my gut it was justified
[08/02/2022, 15:27:57] ~Talia✨: Like he has shady morals on a lot of things
And with Josh I never know
[08/02/2022, 19:07:35] Sabrina: I feel like you are
[08/02/2022, 19:07:47] Sabrina: I’m sorry
[08/02/2022, 19:07:51] Sabrina: That sucks
[08/02/2022, 19:08:49] Sabrina: Yeah and the thing is you did put in a clause of ‘if I’m wrong, tell me’
[09/02/2022, 11:10:37] ~Talia✨: And he lost it again today
[09/02/2022, 11:11:55] Sabrina: Has he tried to picture the position you were in?
[09/02/2022, 11:21:01] ~Talia✨: No
[09/02/2022, 11:21:08] ~Talia✨: He lost it because I turned my phone off
[09/02/2022, 11:21:13] ~Talia✨: And I was worried
[09/02/2022, 11:21:16] ~Talia✨: He*
[09/02/2022, 11:21:24] ~Talia✨: He went off on me
[09/02/2022, 11:21:44] ~Talia✨: Saying I could’ve at least said I was turning my phone off
[09/02/2022, 11:22:01] Sabrina: I’m not liking him very much right now
[09/02/2022, 11:22:11] ~Talia✨: I’m honestly so annoyed
[09/02/2022, 11:22:22] ~Talia✨: But I just apologised and left it
[09/02/2022, 11:22:29] Sabrina: The audacity
[09/02/2022, 11:22:42] ~Talia✨: He literally lost it
[09/02/2022, 11:22:48] ~Talia✨: Said I don’t care about anyone but myself
[09/02/2022, 11:23:00] Sabrina: Is something else going on with him?
[09/02/2022, 11:23:16] ~Talia✨: That’s what I was thinking exactly
[09/02/2022, 11:23:44] ~Talia✨: He lost it sis
[09/02/2022, 11:23:47] Sabrina: A wee bit frustrating
[09/02/2022, 11:23:50] ~Talia✨: I was like surely not over this
[09/02/2022, 11:24:13] ~Talia✨: He’s turned his phone off on how many occasions
[09/02/2022, 11:24:19] Sabrina: I think he cares so much that he’s just not expressing it properly
[09/02/2022, 11:24:22] ~Talia✨: I didn’t lose my shit
[09/02/2022, 11:24:26] ~Talia✨: Exactly
[09/02/2022, 11:24:38] ~Talia✨: He was like I care too much and it’s gonna kill me
[09/02/2022, 11:24:49] ~Talia✨: He couldn’t breathe and shit apparently
[09/02/2022, 11:25:13] ~Talia✨: Am I being inconsiderate
[09/02/2022, 11:25:20] Sabrina: No
[09/02/2022, 11:25:24] ~Talia✨: Or like is he being dramatic
[09/02/2022, 11:25:33] ~Talia✨: He was like I brought back PTSD
[09/02/2022, 11:25:35] Sabrina: He’s being a bit narrow minded
[09/02/2022, 11:25:43] ~Talia✨: I just wow
[09/02/2022, 17:49:58] ~Talia✨: Lost his shit again
[09/02/2022, 17:50:03] ~Talia✨: Over his mom this time
[09/02/2022, 22:38:21] Sabrina: Well
[09/02/2022, 22:38:27] Sabrina: Spotlight’s temporarily off you
[10/02/2022, 06:49:52] ~Talia✨: No
[10/02/2022, 06:49:58] ~Talia✨: He lost it with me
[10/02/2022, 06:50:25] ~Talia✨: Over how me and his mom don’t get along
[10/02/2022, 09:21:43] Sabrina: What the hell is his problem
[10/02/2022, 09:30:43] ~Talia✨: He’s upset

[16/02/2022, 17:27:54] Sabrina: Agh no man I’m sorry
[16/02/2022, 17:28:05] Sabrina: I don’t know about you but period mood swings have hit a new high
