[27/02/2021, 07:31:00] Sabrina: It‚Äôs happy
[27/02/2021, 07:31:04] ~Talia‚ú®: It‚Äôs just weird

[27/02/2021, 07:34:31] ~Talia‚ú®: I like it on you better
[27/02/2021, 14:06:19] Sabrina: Am I that oblivious to everything that goes on
[27/02/2021, 14:06:36] ~Talia‚ú®: Why?
[27/02/2021, 14:08:06] Sabrina: A kid has been coming to my house every weekend for a month now and I had no idea
[27/02/2021, 14:08:25] Sabrina: Sebs been teaching him maths
[27/02/2021, 14:08:37] Sabrina: Like how would I not know
And my whole family knows but me
[27/02/2021, 14:08:44] Sabrina: It blows my mind
[27/02/2021, 14:08:53] ~Talia‚ú®: Wait
[27/02/2021, 14:08:54] ~Talia‚ú®: How
[27/02/2021, 14:09:00] Sabrina: I don‚Äôt know!
[27/02/2021, 14:09:05] ~Talia‚ú®: Like how could you not know
‚Äé[27/02/2021, 14:09:23] Sabrina: ‚Äéimage omitted
[27/02/2021, 14:09:36] Sabrina: I know right!
[27/02/2021, 14:09:42] ~Talia‚ú®: No you really are oblivious
[27/02/2021, 14:09:57] Sabrina: It‚Äôs kind of impossible and yet it‚Äôs possible
[27/02/2021, 14:10:19] Sabrina: And I only found out because seb asked if I had whiteboard markers
[27/02/2021, 14:10:19] ~Talia‚ú®: Sis 
A whole month
[27/02/2021, 14:10:25] Sabrina: And it‚Äôs his last lesson today
[27/02/2021, 14:10:28] Sabrina: I would have never known
[27/02/2021, 14:10:47] Sabrina: And apparently last week his brother came and just roamed the house for an hour
[27/02/2021, 14:10:54] Sabrina: Had a cat chat with my dad as well
[27/02/2021, 14:11:01] Sabrina: fat chat*
[27/02/2021, 14:11:02] ~Talia‚ú®: Maybe you can do that tomorrow sleeping
[27/02/2021, 14:11:09] ~Talia‚ú®: You were sleeping *^
[27/02/2021, 14:11:38] Sabrina: Probably 50% of his visits I was
[27/02/2021, 14:11:59] Sabrina: But there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôve been consistently asleep from 3-4 every weekend
[27/02/2021, 14:12:16] ~Talia‚ú®: Then you‚Äôre just oblivious
[27/02/2021, 14:12:30] Sabrina: We‚Äôre complete opposites üòÇ
[27/02/2021, 14:12:37] Sabrina: You know everything that goes on with everything
[27/02/2021, 14:12:46] Sabrina: I know nothing that goes on with nothing
[27/02/2021, 14:12:49] ~Talia‚ú®: Because I‚Äôm nosy
[27/02/2021, 14:12:57] Sabrina: And I‚Äôm blind and deaf
[27/02/2021, 14:14:25] ~Talia‚ú®: Clearly
[27/02/2021, 14:14:36] ~Talia‚ú®: Which is ironic considering I am the blind one
[27/02/2021, 14:14:54] Sabrina: Yeah ü§£
[27/02/2021, 14:15:02] Sabrina: How was the optometrist
[27/02/2021, 14:15:12] Sabrina: Did you get the contact in in the end
[27/02/2021, 14:15:47] ~Talia‚ú®: They canceled cause I wasn‚Äôt wearing it long enough
[27/02/2021, 14:16:02] Sabrina: What was the appointment for
[27/02/2021, 14:16:16] Sabrina: To check how your eye was doing?
[27/02/2021, 14:16:35] ~Talia‚ú®: No to see if my contacts adjusted
[27/02/2021, 14:16:41] ~Talia‚ú®: But I didn‚Äôt wear them so
[27/02/2021, 14:16:44] Sabrina: Ah
[27/02/2021, 14:16:51] ~Talia‚ú®: Yes
[27/02/2021, 14:16:52] Sabrina: You should maybe probably start doing that
[27/02/2021, 14:17:09] ~Talia‚ú®: Great suggestion
Thanks
[27/02/2021, 14:17:20] Sabrina: Always glad to be of assistance
[27/02/2021, 14:17:31] ~Talia‚ú®: Appreciate it sis
[27/02/2021, 14:18:02] Sabrina: Get this
[27/02/2021, 14:18:08] ~Talia‚ú®: Yee
[27/02/2021, 14:18:35] Sabrina: The woman at the store cracked my screen protector as she put it on, and I didn‚Äôt notice it until I got home and took it out
[27/02/2021, 14:19:00] Sabrina: I saw it at the store but I thought it was a hair or something
[27/02/2021, 14:19:19] Sabrina: So my record time for an uncracked screen protector is apparently a second
[27/02/2021, 14:20:36] ~Talia‚ú®: Oh wow.
[27/02/2021, 14:20:38] ~Talia‚ú®: I mean
[27/02/2021, 14:20:40] ~Talia‚ú®: Shorter than mine
[27/02/2021, 14:21:05] Sabrina: I should report it as a Guinness world record
[27/02/2021, 14:21:58] ~Talia‚ú®: My friends brother got a phone
[27/02/2021, 14:22:06] ~Talia‚ú®: And on the way to the car he dropped it and cracked it
[27/02/2021, 14:22:20] Sabrina: Oh my god that‚Äôs unlucky
[27/02/2021, 14:22:28] ~Talia‚ú®: So unlucky
[27/02/2021, 14:22:33] ~Talia‚ú®: Funny 
But unlucky
[27/02/2021, 15:41:00] ~Talia‚ú®: Can I tell you.
[27/02/2021, 15:41:53] Sabrina: And then she stops typing
[27/02/2021, 15:41:58] ~Talia‚ú®: Oh
[27/02/2021, 15:42:02] ~Talia‚ú®: I was waiting for a yes
[27/02/2021, 15:42:08] ~Talia‚ú®: Build up emphasis
[27/02/2021, 15:42:14] ~Talia‚ú®: Anyways
[27/02/2021, 15:42:15] Sabrina: Of course
[27/02/2021, 15:42:20] Sabrina: You want the dramaticism
[27/02/2021, 15:42:22] ~Talia‚ú®: Yk me and how I am
[27/02/2021, 15:42:24] ~Talia‚ú®: Ofc

Like what have I become
[27/02/2021, 15:43:05] ~Talia‚ú®: A hoe to a housewife
[27/02/2021, 15:43:28] Sabrina: I think making a bed ranks one higher than that but still geez
[27/02/2021, 15:43:39] Sabrina: Didn‚Äôt think married life would hit you so early
[27/02/2021, 15:44:05] ~Talia‚ú®: But still geez
[27/02/2021, 15:44:21] Sabrina: How was the stay
[27/02/2021, 15:44:54] ~Talia‚ú®: Didn‚Äôt really stay over cause of logistical issues
[27/02/2021, 15:45:00] ~Talia‚ú®: But spent most of my time there with him
[27/02/2021, 15:45:04] ~Talia‚ú®: Neither did I.
[27/02/2021, 15:45:39] Sabrina: What happened with the disagree

[27/02/2021, 15:46:42] Sabrina: Seems like the type
[27/02/2021, 15:46:50] Sabrina: ‚ÄúWhen it‚Äôs the one, it‚Äôs the one‚Äù
[27/02/2021, 15:46:53] ~Talia‚ú®: He says to me a 
‚Äú a baby with the curls and your eyes, my god‚Äù
[27/02/2021, 15:47:12] ~Talia‚ú®: No we never thought we‚Äôd the type
[27/02/2021, 15:48:17] Sabrina: No like
When you‚Äôre serious, you‚Äôre serious
[27/02/2021, 15:48:23] ~Talia‚ú®: I know
[27/02/2021, 15:48:24] ~Talia‚ú®: But
[27/02/2021, 15:48:26] Sabrina: Tbf it is quite dramatic
[27/02/2021, 15:48:28] Sabrina: Like
[27/02/2021, 15:48:33] ~Talia‚ú®: It‚Äôs very dramatic
[27/02/2021, 15:48:41] Sabrina: You‚Äôve excerciesed the word dramatic to talk full extent
[27/02/2021, 15:48:51] ~Talia‚ú®: Yebo
[27/02/2021, 15:49:26] ~Talia‚ú®: I just
[27/02/2021, 15:49:27] ~Talia‚ú®: Wow
[27/02/2021, 15:49:46] Sabrina: Seb asks why you needed my number
[27/02/2021, 15:50:06] ~Talia‚ú®: Oh cause my number was registered and it kicked me out
[27/02/2021, 15:50:19] ~Talia‚ú®: So I wanted a new account
[27/02/2021, 15:50:25] ~Talia‚ú®: And I needed to use your number
[27/02/2021, 15:50:32] Sabrina: It kicked you out?
[27/02/2021, 15:50:45] ~Talia‚ú®: Yeah but it was cause I was underage
[27/02/2021, 15:50:47] ~Talia‚ú®: So it didn‚Äôt matter
[27/02/2021, 15:50:52] Sabrina: Why didn‚Äôt you tell him to make one üòÇ
[27/02/2021, 15:50:56] ~Talia‚ú®: I used a different one
[27/02/2021, 15:51:01] ~Talia‚ú®: Didn‚Äôt wanna
[27/02/2021, 15:51:11] ~Talia‚ú®: It was my thing
[27/02/2021, 15:51:28] Sabrina: Sometimes there‚Äôs really no point trying to argue with your logic
[27/02/2021, 15:51:38] ~Talia‚ú®: Because it‚Äôs bad?
[27/02/2021, 15:52:02] Sabrina: Mostly dumb, but yes also bad
[27/02/2021, 15:52:22] ~Talia‚ú®: It‚Äôs fine
[27/02/2021, 15:52:26] ~Talia‚ú®: I sorted it out anyways
[27/02/2021, 15:52:32] ~Talia‚ú®: And I got my nice little suite
[27/02/2021, 15:52:48] Sabrina: But you didn‚Äôt
[27/02/2021, 15:52:53] ~Talia‚ú®: And I got to sit in a bubble bath with him and put bubbles all over his face
[27/02/2021, 15:53:10] Sabrina: But your hair
[27/02/2021, 15:53:31] ~Talia‚ú®: But I did?
I just got it on another system
[27/02/2021, 15:53:39] ~Talia‚ú®: Tied it up
[27/02/2021, 15:53:45] Sabrina: You didn‚Äôt even stay for the bed or the breakfast
[27/02/2021, 15:53:45] ~Talia‚ú®: He said the same thing üòÇü•∫
[27/02/2021, 15:53:53] ~Talia‚ú®: We went back this morning
[27/02/2021, 15:54:02] ~Talia‚ú®: And spent most of the day there
[27/02/2021, 15:54:08] ~Talia‚ú®: And basically the whole of yesterday
[27/02/2021, 15:55:04] Sabrina: Your logic really baffles me
[27/02/2021, 15:55:13] ~Talia‚ú®: It wasn‚Äôt supposed to be like that
[28/02/2021, 06:49:55] ~Talia‚ú®: Question
[28/02/2021, 07:58:14] Sabrina: Yeah?
[28/02/2021, 08:05:25] ~Talia‚ú®: Did we end up writing that maths test with booi
[28/02/2021, 08:05:54] Sabrina: No
[28/02/2021, 08:06:45] ~Talia‚ú®: That‚Äôs crazy
[28/02/2021, 08:23:10] ~Talia‚ú®: Lemme tell you
[28/02/2021, 08:23:34] Sabrina: Yes?
[28/02/2021, 08:25:20] ~Talia‚ú®: Tweeds is a lot more serious than I am when it comes to long term 
And I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs cause I‚Äôm scared
[28/02/2021, 08:25:32] ~Talia‚ú®: Or I just don‚Äôt think like that
[28/02/2021, 08:31:02] Sabrina: Scared is the normal reaction
[28/02/2021, 08:31:14] ~Talia‚ú®: Sis
[28/02/2021, 08:31:36] ~Talia‚ú®: He put my name and his surname together and goes: ‚Äú it doesn‚Äôt sound too bad yeah, has a nice ring to it‚Äù
[28/02/2021, 08:33:20] Sabrina: Sounds like you‚Äôre not in it as serious as he is
[28/02/2021, 08:33:34] ~Talia‚ú®: I am
[28/02/2021, 08:33:43] ~Talia‚ú®: Because the worst part is
[28/02/2021, 08:33:48] ~Talia‚ú®: I didn‚Äôt mind it at all
[28/02/2021, 08:33:56] Sabrina: Then you‚Äôre not scared
[28/02/2021, 08:34:16] ~Talia‚ú®: I just didn‚Äôt know I could be this serious
[28/02/2021, 08:34:19] Sabrina: It‚Äôs not necessarily bad
[28/02/2021, 08:34:20] ~Talia‚ú®: It‚Äôs a new world
[28/02/2021, 08:34:28] ~Talia‚ú®: It‚Äôs not 
But it is scary
[28/02/2021, 08:34:30] Sabrina: Well go with the flow
[28/02/2021, 08:34:38] ~Talia‚ú®: Trying to
[28/02/2021, 08:34:39] Sabrina: But you‚Äôre not scared
[28/02/2021, 08:34:52] ~Talia‚ú®: I‚Äôm not scared of it 
But the idea within itself is scary
[28/02/2021, 08:35:07] Sabrina: Sure it is
[28/02/2021, 08:35:17] Sabrina: But if it‚Äôs not scary to you then you shouldn‚Äôt be worried
[28/02/2021, 08:35:24] ~Talia‚ú®: Fair enough
[28/02/2021, 08:35:33] Sabrina: It‚Äôs like horror movies are scary but not all people are scared by it
[28/02/2021, 08:36:00] ~Talia‚ú®: I guess so
[28/02/2021, 08:36:04] Sabrina: If he puts your name with his surname and you don‚Äôt mind, might as well go with it
[28/02/2021, 08:36:41] ~Talia‚ú®: I don‚Äôt wanna have expectations for something that isn‚Äôt gonna work out like that
[28/02/2021, 08:36:51] Sabrina: You don‚Äôt know that it won‚Äôt
[28/02/2021, 08:37:00] ~Talia‚ú®: I don‚Äôt know that it will either
[28/02/2021, 08:37:18] Sabrina: It‚Äôs not even expectation
[28/02/2021, 08:37:21] Sabrina: It‚Äôs just a thought
[28/02/2021, 08:37:42] Sabrina: It‚Äôs just a nice thought that he thought and shared it with you
[28/02/2021, 08:37:51] Sabrina: It‚Äôs not confirming a marriage proposal
[28/02/2021, 08:37:53] ~Talia‚ú®: Yeah you‚Äôre right
[28/02/2021, 08:38:12] ~Talia‚ú®: It‚Äôs not no

I guess so
Or

[28/02/2021, 08:39:55] ~Talia‚ú®: ‚ÄúI could do this forever‚Äù he said.
[28/02/2021, 08:40:02] Sabrina: So could you

[28/02/2021, 08:41:05] ~Talia‚ú®: Him and I were speaking about you when it came to the whole break up
[28/02/2021, 08:41:19] ~Talia‚ú®: And he was like 
You were on your own steez
[28/02/2021, 08:41:37] ~Talia‚ú®: And I said to her

[28/02/2021, 08:42:05] ~Talia‚ú®: Cause this could be have longevity
[28/02/2021, 08:43:33] Sabrina: Thing is 
If his reasons were more valid, I wouldn‚Äôt have been as pissed
[28/02/2021, 08:43:53] ~Talia‚ú®: Yeah I know where you were coming from sis üòÇ

[13/03/2021, 16:40:13] Sabrina: So I asked
[13/03/2021, 16:43:21] ~Talia‚ú®: That‚Äôs crazy

[14/03/2021, 18:26:58] ~Talia‚ú®: This is random
[14/03/2021, 18:27:00] ~Talia‚ú®: And deep
[14/03/2021, 18:27:59] Sabrina: Yes?
[14/03/2021, 18:28:46] ~Talia‚ú®: Caleb and I were speaking in the car yesterday
[14/03/2021, 18:28:51] ~Talia‚ú®: Just about life and everything
[14/03/2021, 18:29:03] ~Talia‚ú®: He starts talking about how he‚Äôd parent his kids and shit
[14/03/2021, 18:29:30] Sabrina: Okay
[14/03/2021, 18:30:08] ~Talia‚ú®: And I realized
[14/03/2021, 18:30:27] ~Talia‚ú®: We have two very different views on kids
[14/03/2021, 18:31:14] Sabrina: Different childhoods different upbringings yeah that makes sense

[14/03/2021, 18:31:54] Sabrina: And the problem is
[14/03/2021, 18:32:14] ~Talia‚ú®: The more we speak about children the more I realize I don‚Äôt want them
[14/03/2021, 18:32:49] Sabrina: Your reasoning for not wanting them isn‚Äôt because of the sake of having children themselves
[14/03/2021, 18:32:57] ~Talia‚ú®: And me saying I‚Äôd consider them with him is a lie because I‚Äôm not meant to be a mother
[14/03/2021, 18:34:03] Sabrina: That‚Äôs not necessarily true
[14/03/2021, 18:38:37] ~Talia‚ú®: Not entirely

Couple years back my aunt divorced my uncle to be dramatic and she regrets it

[21/03/2021, 15:55:25] Sabrina: I didn‚Äôt know what to say so I just let him talk until he stopped crying cause he doesn‚Äôt like it either 
Hence the realisation
[21/03/2021, 15:55:45] ~Talia‚ú®: Do you mean intimacy or vulnerability sis?
[21/03/2021, 15:56:00] Sabrina: Stuff I didn‚Äôt realise was eating me up

Crying is more vulnerability then anything else

[21/03/2021, 16:25:08] ~Talia‚ú®: And the fact that I‚Äôd do it all with him is deep.
[21/03/2021, 16:25:17] Sabrina: You don‚Äôt say
[21/03/2021, 16:25:27] ~Talia‚ú®: And I don‚Äôt think I could do it again
[21/03/2021, 16:25:38] Sabrina: We‚Äôll see what happens
[21/03/2021, 16:25:42] ~Talia‚ú®: We will
[21/03/2021, 16:26:01] ~Talia‚ú®: He just freaks me out when he speaks marriage and kids and shit
[21/03/2021, 16:26:15] Sabrina: As one does yes
[21/03/2021, 16:26:42] ~Talia‚ú®: I just 
Yeah
[21/03/2021, 16:27:06] Sabrina: Do you think you‚Äôre ever going to get over this Boulder
[21/03/2021, 16:27:17] ~Talia‚ú®: Which one?
[21/03/2021, 16:27:20] ~Talia‚ú®: You need to specify
[21/03/2021, 16:27:40] Sabrina: There‚Äôs only one
[21/03/2021, 16:27:51] Sabrina: That we‚Äôre speaking about right now
[21/03/2021, 16:27:57] ~Talia‚ú®: Marriage ?
[21/03/2021, 16:28:10] Sabrina: No this whole
I don‚Äôt think I can do it issues
[21/03/2021, 16:28:25] Sabrina: From marriage to kids to all that
[21/03/2021, 16:28:35] ~Talia‚ú®: Oh
[21/03/2021, 16:28:39] ~Talia‚ú®: I can do it
[21/03/2021, 16:28:42] ~Talia‚ú®: It‚Äôs not the problem
[21/03/2021, 16:28:50] ~Talia‚ú®: It‚Äôs 
Is that what I really want
[21/03/2021, 16:29:10] Sabrina: Your life isn‚Äôt set in stone
[21/03/2021, 16:29:34] ~Talia‚ú®: I know
[21/03/2021, 16:29:33] Sabrina: What you want now will differ from what you want in ten years
Or it might not 
You‚Äôve got to wait and see what happens
[21/03/2021, 16:29:45] ~Talia‚ú®: If he never mentioned marriage and kids and shir
[21/03/2021, 16:29:52] ~Talia‚ú®: It would never come out of my mouth
[21/03/2021, 16:29:59] ~Talia‚ú®: I‚Äôd never come to you and be like

I‚Äôd marry this man
[21/03/2021, 16:30:54] Sabrina: I think what‚Äôs preventing you from considering it is the fact that it‚Äôs unconventional 
If everyone found the love of their lives and got married and the whole shebang before the age of 18, it would probably be different
[21/03/2021, 16:31:25] ~Talia‚ú®: I refuse to get married before 25.
[21/03/2021, 16:31:25] Sabrina: You‚Äôre realistic self isn‚Äôt letting you think of these things because you‚Äôre resorting to all youve ever known
[21/03/2021, 16:31:42] Sabrina: Why.
[21/03/2021, 16:31:57] ~Talia‚ú®: It‚Äôs just 
A huge life decision
[21/03/2021, 16:32:09] ~Talia‚ú®: It‚Äôs not even about that
[21/03/2021, 16:32:12] Sabrina: Marriage is a piece of paper that conforms to social norms of other people
[21/03/2021, 16:32:21] ~Talia‚ú®: I just don‚Äôt wanna set the expectation too high
[21/03/2021, 16:32:23] Sabrina: Some people never get married but stay together their whole life
[21/03/2021, 16:32:31] ~Talia‚ú®: Marriage is a life long commitment
[21/03/2021, 16:32:33] Sabrina: Because you‚Äôve learnt to not set expectations
[21/03/2021, 16:32:34] ~Talia‚ú®: I‚Äôd rather do that
[21/03/2021, 16:32:38] ~Talia‚ú®: Yes
[21/03/2021, 16:32:40] ~Talia‚ú®: And it works
[21/03/2021, 16:32:41] ~Talia‚ú®: Also
[21/03/2021, 16:32:46] Sabrina: Again, stuff you‚Äôve known all your life.
[21/03/2021, 16:32:50] ~Talia‚ú®: Yes
[21/03/2021, 16:32:52] ~Talia‚ú®: I know that
[21/03/2021, 16:32:53] ~Talia‚ú®: But
[21/03/2021, 16:32:54] ~Talia‚ú®: Wow
[21/03/2021, 16:32:55] ~Talia‚ú®: I just
[21/03/2021, 16:32:56] ~Talia‚ú®: Uh
[21/03/2021, 16:33:31] Sabrina: It‚Äôs literally the same thing. The only difference is there‚Äôs a connotation attached with the word marriage
[21/03/2021, 16:33:57] ~Talia‚ú®: Yeah and marriage is scary
[21/03/2021, 16:34:00] ~Talia‚ú®: I‚Äôd actually be a Mrs
[21/03/2021, 16:34:08] ~Talia‚ú®: Not an unofficial one
[21/03/2021, 16:34:12] Sabrina: Marriage is a piece of paper
[21/03/2021, 16:34:23] Sabrina: How you define it is up to yourself and your partner
[21/03/2021, 16:34:27] ~Talia‚ú®: Marriage is the second most legally binding document after death
[21/03/2021, 16:34:50] Sabrina: And is that not a piece of paper
[21/03/2021, 16:34:56] ~Talia‚ú®: Yes.
[21/03/2021, 16:35:00] ~Talia‚ú®: That holds power
[21/03/2021, 16:35:03] ~Talia‚ú®: That‚Äôs not the point
[21/03/2021, 16:35:06] Sabrina: Rock beats paper
[21/03/2021, 16:35:09] ~Talia‚ú®: Not before 25 
My mom would say I‚Äôm too young
[21/03/2021, 16:35:09] Sabrina: All I‚Äôm saying
[21/03/2021, 16:35:20] ~Talia‚ú®: Kids
I just don‚Äôt want
[21/03/2021, 16:35:29] ~Talia‚ú®: I don‚Äôt want my life to be tied down to kids
[21/03/2021, 16:36:15] Sabrina: If you let your life depend on the opinions of other people you‚Äôll never be able to live for yourself
[21/03/2021, 16:36:22] Sabrina: This is something that some people never get past
[21/03/2021, 16:36:27] ~Talia‚ú®: It‚Äôs also my mother
[21/03/2021, 16:36:34] ~Talia‚ú®: And that‚Äôs not the point
[21/03/2021, 16:36:42] ~Talia‚ú®: I always wanted to build my own life then settle
[21/03/2021, 16:36:49] ~Talia‚ú®: Not settle then build
[21/03/2021, 16:36:49] Sabrina: There are certain limitations that having kids bring but saying that it ties your down is not the right mindset
[21/03/2021, 16:37:02] ~Talia‚ú®: I don‚Äôt want them. 
End of disrespect
[21/03/2021, 16:37:09] ~Talia‚ú®: Discussion*^
[21/03/2021, 16:37:13] Sabrina: There are people who have gone on to get their phd‚Äôs while having a two year old puking over their thesis
[21/03/2021, 16:37:23] ~Talia‚ú®: I don‚Äôt want them.
[21/03/2021, 16:38:24] Sabrina: Okay
[21/03/2021, 16:38:28] Sabrina: I‚Äôm only gonna ask this once
[21/03/2021, 16:39:32] ~Talia‚ú®: Okay taking off now
[21/03/2021, 16:39:34] ~Talia‚ú®: Will answer later
[21/03/2021, 16:39:35] ~Talia‚ú®: Bye
[21/03/2021, 16:39:36] ~Talia‚ú®: Love you
[21/03/2021, 16:39:45] Sabrina: Will I ever be able to get you to have an open mind
Not trying to convince you to have kids or anything that‚Äôs a decision you make
[21/03/2021, 16:39:53] Sabrina: Otherwise I‚Äôll never utter another word about it
[21/03/2021, 16:40:06] Sabrina: Ah so it was 5.45
[21/03/2021, 16:41:32] ~Talia‚ú®: Yes
[21/03/2021, 16:41:44] ~Talia‚ú®: I will have one about it
[21/03/2021, 16:41:59] ~Talia‚ú®: When I know where both of us are going to university
[21/03/2021, 16:42:04] ~Talia‚ú®: After that 
Yes I‚Äôll be open
[21/03/2021, 19:30:22] ~Talia‚ú®: Guess whose home
[21/03/2021, 19:30:33] ~Talia‚ú®: And ready to annoy you once again
[21/03/2021, 19:30:49] Sabrina: Hello
[21/03/2021, 19:31:08] ~Talia‚ú®: Helloü•∫

[23/03/2021, 11:19:00] Sabrina: No that‚Äôs scary

[24/03/2021, 17:58:24] Sabrina: üòÇüòÇ
[24/03/2021, 17:58:30] Sabrina: You look like you‚Äôre about to cry
[24/03/2021, 17:58:42] ~Talia‚ú®: I‚Äôm not
[24/03/2021, 17:58:44] ~Talia‚ú®: But she‚Äôs baxk
[24/03/2021, 17:58:51] ~Talia‚ú®: And she turned salt for me
[24/03/2021, 17:59:22] Sabrina: Hence the laugh
[24/03/2021, 17:59:35] ~Talia‚ú®: üòÇüòÇ
[24/03/2021, 17:59:49] Sabrina: Idk what that means
[24/03/2021, 18:00:00] ~Talia‚ú®: Remember I told you
[24/03/2021, 18:00:14] ~Talia‚ú®: Indians turn salt when a girl gets lots of attention
[24/03/2021, 18:00:14] Sabrina: Oh oh yes
[24/03/2021, 18:00:16] Sabrina: I remember
[24/03/2021, 18:00:30] Sabrina: Sorry sorry brain fart
[24/03/2021, 18:00:38] ~Talia‚ú®: Removes the evil eye
Apparently
[24/03/2021, 18:00:53] Sabrina: Wait so like
[24/03/2021, 18:01:14] Sabrina: You‚Äôre now sent out into the world?
[24/03/2021, 18:01:25] ~Talia‚ú®: NoüòÇ
[24/03/2021, 18:01:37] Sabrina: How can she turn salt for you
[24/03/2021, 18:01:46] Sabrina: The for is throwing me off
[24/03/2021, 18:01:47] ~Talia‚ú®: Wum how
[24/03/2021, 18:01:54] ~Talia‚ú®: Oh
[24/03/2021, 18:01:58] ~Talia‚ú®: She takes salt
[24/03/2021, 18:02:03] ~Talia‚ú®: And makes a circle around me
[24/03/2021, 18:02:12] ~Talia‚ú®: With the salt in her hand
[24/03/2021, 18:02:14] Sabrina: Omg was it a whole ceremony
[24/03/2021, 18:02:20] ~Talia‚ú®: NoüòÇüíÄ
[24/03/2021, 18:02:26] ~Talia‚ú®: She told me to stand up mid episode
[24/03/2021, 18:02:32] ~Talia‚ú®: Quite rude actually
[24/03/2021, 18:02:34] ~Talia‚ú®: Anyways
[24/03/2021, 18:02:37] Sabrina: üòÇ
[24/03/2021, 18:02:42] ~Talia‚ú®: What‚Äôs your opinion on the Camille thing
[24/03/2021, 18:02:46] Sabrina: How modern
Mid episode
[24/03/2021, 18:03:02] Sabrina: I‚Äôm not taking sides
[24/03/2021, 18:03:12] ~Talia‚ú®: Didn‚Äôt ask you to
[24/03/2021, 18:03:14] Sabrina: I‚Äôd like to think of myself as neutral in this situation
[24/03/2021, 18:03:16] Sabrina: What about you
[24/03/2021, 18:03:22] ~Talia‚ú®: Just what you think
[24/03/2021, 18:03:50] ~Talia‚ú®: What josh did wasn‚Äôt right in the slightest but she was more upset about it than Troy√© was which made it look a lot worse than it was
[24/03/2021, 18:04:08] ~Talia‚ú®: And also bringing Caleb into it wasn‚Äôt helping her situation
[24/03/2021, 18:04:10] Sabrina: Yes
[24/03/2021, 18:04:23] ~Talia‚ú®: And her mentioning me and saying I must control him pissed me off slightly
[24/03/2021, 18:04:43] ~Talia‚ú®: And then her saying 
Oh I don‚Äôt know how you do it,goodluck 
Really annoyed me
[24/03/2021, 18:04:44] Sabrina: It was rage talk
[24/03/2021, 18:05:20] ~Talia‚ú®: Don‚Äôt care 
Don‚Äôt bring me into it when you don‚Äôt get your way
[24/03/2021, 18:05:33] ~Talia‚ú®: I‚Äôm a Mrs not his controller
[24/03/2021, 18:06:07] Sabrina: Okay yes however it‚Äôs just a slightly more extreme version of when you say ‚Äòcontrol your mans‚Äô to Otilie
[24/03/2021, 18:06:11] Sabrina: Just for example
[24/03/2021, 18:06:36] ~Talia‚ú®: But mine was never in a serious situation
[24/03/2021, 18:06:52] ~Talia‚ú®: She was like
‚ÄúOh yeah speak some sense into him‚Äù
[24/03/2021, 18:06:54] Sabrina: Hence the use of the words more extreme
[24/03/2021, 18:07:11] ~Talia‚ú®: Okay fair
[24/03/2021, 18:07:21] Sabrina: Point being I didn‚Äôt fixate on that part but I can see why it wasn‚Äôt the greatest thing to say
[24/03/2021, 18:07:26] ~Talia‚ú®: Indirectly 
Not direct. Minus
[24/03/2021, 18:08:01] ~Talia‚ú®: I couldn‚Äôt give a fuck about the josh thing
Just don‚Äôt involve me when you‚Äôre not getting your way
[24/03/2021, 18:08:45] Sabrina: She went through a lot today
I just feel bad for her
[24/03/2021, 18:08:59] ~Talia‚ú®: She put herself through a lot
[24/03/2021, 18:09:09] ~Talia‚ú®: No one told her to get involved to that extent
[24/03/2021, 18:09:11] Sabrina: One out of the three things yes
[24/03/2021, 18:09:23] ~Talia‚ú®: What‚Äôs the other 2?
[24/03/2021, 18:09:23] Sabrina: I‚Äôm just saying
If Caleb was having surgery you‚Äôd probably be on edge too
[24/03/2021, 18:09:45] Sabrina: One of the relatives had an attempted suicide
[24/03/2021, 18:09:45] ~Talia‚ú®: Oh yeah 
You probably wouldn‚Äôt catch me at school
[24/03/2021, 18:09:52] ~Talia‚ú®: Oof
[24/03/2021, 18:09:53] Sabrina: This information hasn‚Äôt been made public yet
[24/03/2021, 18:10:15] Sabrina: Yeah
[24/03/2021, 18:10:50] Sabrina: His surgery lasted about an hour longer than anticipated and she was literally shaking when she came to art
[24/03/2021, 18:11:14] ~Talia‚ú®: Had a panic attack)
[24/03/2021, 18:11:17] ~Talia‚ú®: ?**
[24/03/2021, 18:11:24] Sabrina: No just overwhelmed
[24/03/2021, 18:11:32] ~Talia‚ú®: Fair enough
[24/03/2021, 18:11:55] Sabrina: Is Josh ok?
[24/03/2021, 18:12:02] ~Talia‚ú®: Not sure
[24/03/2021, 18:12:36] Sabrina: How was ecos

The break is justified 
It‚Äôs understandable

[02/04/2021, 16:20:43] Sabrina: To have a break
[02/04/2021, 16:21:00] Sabrina: It could be that he just needs that confirmation that‚Äôs it‚Äôs you
[02/04/2021, 16:21:04] Sabrina: That‚Äôs one possibility
[02/04/2021, 16:21:15] ~Talia‚ú®: I always had this mindset that solid couples don‚Äôt need breaks
[02/04/2021, 16:21:36] ~Talia‚ú®: But we also move VERY fast

[14/04/2021, 20:27:33] ~Talia‚ú®: And I will give him the option to work on things 
But if he says he doesn‚Äôt want to 
Then that‚Äôs that and I‚Äôm done. No going back
[14/04/2021, 20:28:20] Sabrina: Do you think it‚Äôs a defence mechanism?
[14/04/2021, 20:28:38] Sabrina: Cause otherwise I don‚Äôt know why he‚Äôs speaking the way he is
[14/04/2021, 20:28:54] ~Talia‚ú®: It could be
[14/04/2021, 20:28:56] Sabrina: Will he be willing to to explain
[14/04/2021, 20:29:14] ~Talia‚ú®: Idk

[14/04/2021, 20:30:39] ~Talia‚ú®: I‚Äôm giving him that option 
And if he takes it okay
And if he doesn‚Äôt okay
[14/04/2021, 20:30:56] ~Talia‚ú®: I do think it‚Äôs worth fighting for 
Not if I‚Äôm the only one fighting
[14/04/2021, 20:32:10] Sabrina: I‚Äôm a little concerned that intention is gonna be an issue when you guys speak
[14/04/2021, 20:32:28] Sabrina: Cause you not fighting for it could come off as you don‚Äôt care enough to
[14/04/2021, 20:32:29] ~Talia‚ú®: Wum intention
[14/04/2021, 20:32:37] ~Talia‚ú®: No
[14/04/2021, 20:32:44] ~Talia‚ú®: I‚Äôm willing to listen and work through
[14/04/2021, 20:33:00] ~Talia‚ú®: But if he says 
I‚Äôm done Then I won‚Äôt beg like I did last time
[14/04/2021, 20:33:11] Sabrina: Yeah I‚Äôm just saying when you two are speaking your intention might not be that clear
[14/04/2021, 20:33:23] ~Talia‚ú®: Okay yeah fair
[14/04/2021, 20:33:39] Sabrina: Him saying I‚Äôm done might not have conveyed his intended thoughts
[14/04/2021, 20:33:40] Sabrina: Yeah

[14/04/2021, 20:33:56] Sabrina: You know how you like giving him little tests
[14/04/2021, 20:33:56] ~Talia‚ú®: I wanna hear his intended thoughts
[14/04/2021, 20:34:03] Sabrina: What if this is a test
[14/04/2021, 20:34:09] Sabrina: And how he tests you
[14/04/2021, 20:34:17] Sabrina: I hope he tells you
[14/04/2021, 20:34:17] ~Talia‚ú®: This isn‚Äôt a test sis
[14/04/2021, 20:34:22] Sabrina: And I hope they come off right
[14/04/2021, 20:34:26] ~Talia‚ú®: And if it

Works slowly
[09/05/2021, 17:12:14] ~Talia‚ú®: Like the shopping trip that‚Äôs takes me 20 mins takes him like 45
[09/05/2021, 17:12:28] Sabrina: Well you‚Äôre a different type but sure
[09/05/2021, 17:12:47] ~Talia‚ú®: He wants to go to CNA when we can just go to clicks grab it on the way out since it‚Äôs the same direction as we parked
[09/05/2021, 17:13:03] ~Talia‚ú®: Like what‚Äôs the logic there
[09/05/2021, 17:13:13] Sabrina: DUDE I EXPERIENCED THE SAME THING
[09/05/2021, 17:13:36] ~Talia‚ú®: Then he wants to get out the car to open the boot when you can just pull the seat down and grab what he needed from the boot.
[09/05/2021, 17:13:38] ~Talia‚ú®: Like
Huh
[09/05/2021, 17:13:46] Sabrina: Yesterday kian went to woolies to get a card cause he wanted to buy chicken strips for himself

[09/05/2021, 17:14:40] Sabrina: No I definitely wouldn‚Äôt think that far
[09/05/2021, 17:15:08] Sabrina: He had to get a card for Mother‚Äôs Day and his logic was to go to woolies so he could get himself some chicken strips too
[09/05/2021, 17:15:20] Sabrina: You‚Äôre just built different ok üòÇ
[09/05/2021, 17:15:29] ~Talia‚ú®: Why

And he‚Äôs like
This is why you need a wife.
[09/05/2021, 17:15:54] Sabrina: Cause you gotta climb over chairs and stuff
[09/05/2021, 17:16:03] ~Talia‚ú®: We were in the backseat.
[09/05/2021, 17:16:08] Sabrina: Ah the married couple strikes again
[09/05/2021, 17:16:13] ~Talia‚ú®: Okay yeah that makes sense.
[09/05/2021, 17:16:22] Sabrina: But then you gotta move out of the way it seems like a whole spiel
[09/05/2021, 17:16:26] ~Talia‚ú®: Then we were arguing in clicks
[09/05/2021, 17:16:34] ~Talia‚ú®: It was the easiest thing you could do
[09/05/2021, 17:16:38] Sabrina: About what
[09/05/2021, 17:16:46] ~Talia‚ú®: How fast I move
[09/05/2021, 17:17:12] ~Talia‚ú®: He was like why are you in a rush 
And I said I have things to do 
Then he said like what 
And I said ‚Äúyou‚Äù
[09/05/2021, 17:17:13] Sabrina: Yes you don‚Äôt waste time when you run errands even though all I wanna do is buy an ice cream

[09/05/2021, 17:19:59] Sabrina: Cause I think what you‚Äôre on is a break
[09/05/2021, 17:20:03] Sabrina: Rather than a break up
[09/05/2021, 17:20:20] ~Talia‚ú®: Basically
[09/05/2021, 17:20:30] ~Talia‚ú®: He had a date planned for Friday

[13/06/2021, 09:49:28] Sabrina: We‚Äôll figure something out
[13/06/2021, 09:51:31] ~Talia‚ú®: I don‚Äôt think he will either
[13/06/2021, 09:51:52] ~Talia‚ú®: I just want one event to be not stressful
[13/06/2021, 09:52:11] ~Talia‚ú®: Everything‚Äôs a fight
[13/06/2021, 09:52:25] Sabrina: You‚Äôve already made it this far
[13/06/2021, 09:52:29] Sabrina: Stick it out through the end
[13/06/2021, 09:52:43] ~Talia‚ú®: When‚Äôs the end?üôÉ
[13/06/2021, 09:53:05] Sabrina: I don‚Äôt know but hopefully it‚Äôll lesson after school
[13/06/2021, 09:53:14] ~Talia‚ú®: I hope so too
[13/06/2021, 09:53:25] ~Talia‚ú®: Looks like I‚Äôm flying to London every couple months
[13/06/2021, 09:53:31] Sabrina: Yay :D
[13/06/2021, 09:54:35] ~Talia‚ú®: At this point I don‚Äôt even wanna go
[13/06/2021, 09:54:42] ~Talia‚ú®: It‚Äôs become so stressful
[13/06/2021, 09:55:11] Sabrina: Do you think it‚Äôs worth it though?
[13/06/2021, 09:55:24] ~Talia‚ú®: The dance 
Or the relationship
[13/06/2021, 09:55:45] Sabrina: Oh lol to the dance sorry I got muddled
[13/06/2021, 09:56:02] Sabrina: If you don‚Äôt wanna go then honestly don‚Äôt
[13/06/2021, 09:56:08] Sabrina: I know it‚Äôs not that easy to say that
[13/06/2021, 09:56:28] ~Talia‚ú®: I do wanna go
[13/06/2021, 09:56:31] Sabrina: But if you can ‚Äòrun away‚Äô with him for a night then it‚Äôs probably definitely more worth all the hassle and stress it‚Äôll be at the dance
[13/06/2021, 09:56:50] ~Talia‚ú®: It‚Äôs like the second most important date in the Talia calendar
[13/06/2021, 09:56:59] ~Talia‚ú®: But it‚Äôs not important if he‚Äôs not there
[13/06/2021, 09:57:08] Sabrina: Yeah I know
[13/06/2021, 09:57:09] ~Talia‚ú®: That‚Äôs my person
[13/06/2021, 09:57:12] Sabrina: And I know that too
[13/06/2021, 09:57:29] Sabrina: But I don‚Äôt know what your life is gonna look like in two months
[13/06/2021, 09:57:40] Sabrina: I‚Äôll support you no matter what ‚ò∫Ô∏è
[13/06/2021, 09:58:03] ~Talia‚ú®: I do want to 
But I know if I do 
I‚Äôll be sad the entire night cause he isn‚Äôt there 
If I don‚Äôt I‚Äôll be sad that I didn‚Äôt go 
And I also can‚Äôt not go because like I‚Äôm deputy head of house.  I can‚Äôt not be there.
[13/06/2021, 09:58:23] ~Talia‚ú®: I don‚Äôt know what my life will look like tomorrow 
Coco may wipe me out üòÇüíÄ
[13/06/2021, 09:58:26] ~Talia‚ú®: Thanks sis
[13/06/2021, 09:58:50] Sabrina: The hype of the dance isn‚Äôt all it‚Äôs meant to be
You don‚Äôt like half the people there and you‚Äôll only fully enjoy it if you get to be there with him
[13/06/2021, 09:59:31] Sabrina: I think that‚Äôs the part you‚Äôre mentally blocking out is the stigma of the dance
[13/06/2021, 09:59:37] Sabrina: But of course it‚Äôs all up to you
[13/06/2021, 09:59:47] ~Talia‚ú®: I know
I don‚Äôt like all the people there. But like 5
[13/06/2021, 09:59:58] ~Talia‚ú®: Listen I‚Äôd like to go
[13/06/2021, 10:00:10] Sabrina: Plus we can make our own dance
[13/06/2021, 10:00:24] ~Talia‚ú®: But 
At this point 
If I can‚Äôt go with him. I won‚Äôt even bother
[13/06/2021, 10:00:32] ~Talia‚ú®: I can‚Äôt lie to you
[13/06/2021, 10:00:48] ~Talia‚ú®: I wanted the whole cliche Matric dance thing
[13/06/2021, 10:00:56] ~Talia‚ú®: I really did.
[13/06/2021, 10:01:04] Sabrina: Of course
We all did it makes sense
[13/06/2021, 10:01:15] ~Talia‚ú®: And for once I just wanted something normal to happen
[13/06/2021, 10:01:17] ~Talia‚ú®: Yk
[13/06/2021, 10:01:21] ~Talia‚ú®: No complications
[13/06/2021, 10:01:31] Sabrina: If it helps, to some extent, you lost a lot of that when you came to st John‚Äôs
[13/06/2021, 10:02:01] Sabrina: Yeah unfortunately life doesn‚Äôt like you and it never really works like that in your life
[13/06/2021, 10:02:11] ~Talia‚ú®: Lost a lot of normality?
[13/06/2021, 10:02:20] ~Talia‚ú®: Thanks sis 
Appreciate itüòÇ
[13/06/2021, 10:02:49] Sabrina: Yeah as well as your fantasy matric
The satisfaction of being there with people you grew up with and all the memories of the time at the school
[13/06/2021, 10:02:59] ~Talia‚ú®: Oh yeah that I knew
[13/06/2021, 10:03:26] Sabrina: Just don‚Äôt be miserable
[13/06/2021, 10:03:32] ~Talia‚ú®: I‚Äôm not miserable
[13/06/2021, 10:03:33] Sabrina: Is usually a good motto to live by
[13/06/2021, 10:03:45] ~Talia‚ú®: I just feel bad for him tbh
[13/06/2021, 10:03:52] Sabrina: You‚Äôll be if you‚Äôre there without him
[13/06/2021, 10:04:06] ~Talia‚ú®: I mean 
I guess so
[13/06/2021, 10:04:07] Sabrina: Yeah poor guy
[13/06/2021, 10:04:20] ~Talia‚ú®: And I can‚Äôt even do much for him
[13/06/2021, 10:04:28] ~Talia‚ú®: And I can‚Äôt help but feel like it‚Äôs my fault
[13/06/2021, 10:05:13] Sabrina: Life is a series of choices
[13/06/2021, 10:05:17] Sabrina: You made yours and he made his
[13/06/2021, 10:05:19] Sabrina: Stand by it
[13/06/2021, 10:05:33] ~Talia‚ú®: Did you google that
[13/06/2021, 10:05:40] Sabrina: No it‚Äôs what I live by
[13/06/2021, 10:05:50] Sabrina: My philosophy of sorts
[13/06/2021, 10:06:09] Sabrina: The disrespect üòí
[13/06/2021, 10:06:36] ~Talia‚ú®: It‚Äôs a valid question
[13/06/2021, 10:06:48] Sabrina: I figured it out a couple years ago and it helps a lot in tough situations
[13/06/2021, 10:06:51] Sabrina: Shuttup
[13/06/2021, 10:07:02] ~Talia‚ú®: Fair enough
[13/06/2021, 10:07:15] ~Talia‚ú®: Wouldn‚Äôt be the first
[13/06/2021, 10:07:26] Sabrina: üòÇ wow ok I see how it is
[13/06/2021, 10:07:30] Sabrina: Next time I‚Äôll use yahoo
[13/06/2021, 10:07:41] Sabrina: Listen I‚Äôm gonna love and leave you now
[13/06/2021, 10:07:45] Sabrina: But also
[13/06/2021, 10:07:47] Sabrina: INCOMING
[13/06/2021, 10:07:49] Sabrina: Also yeah I just wanted to apologise I‚Äôm sorry for whatever I‚Äôve been doing for the past few weeks it‚Äôs not personal circumstances or anything it‚Äôs just what I do when things start working out for me I run away and I wanted to warn you this a few months ago but then I figured no I just won‚Äôt do it this time and then the longer time passed the more awkward and scared I became to start up even a conversation again and even now I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing. And the whole time I figured you were probably fighting your own demons as well and I wanted to check up on you but I really overthought it and didn‚Äôt. I really and truly value your friendship and I‚Äôm sorry if I‚Äôve hurt you or made you confused in any way. I‚Äôm gonna try be ‚Äònormal‚Äô again if it‚Äôs ok with you.
[13/06/2021, 10:09:41] ~Talia‚ú®: Oh gosh
[13/06/2021, 10:09:50] ~Talia‚ú®: Yahoo is great
[13/06/2021, 10:09:56] ~Talia‚ú®: Don‚Äôt die driving
[13/06/2021, 10:10:40] ~Talia‚ú®: It‚Äôs just what you do when things are working out for you?

[14/06/2021, 23:57:07] Sabrina: Shouldn‚Äôt you be inside
[15/06/2021, 07:40:58] ~Talia‚ú®: It‚Äôs weird thing 
But I‚Äôm glad things are working out
[15/06/2021, 07:41:04] ~Talia‚ú®: I had cookies in my mouth
[15/06/2021, 07:41:15] ~Talia‚ú®: Mama tested positive too 
So we just roaming the house

[17/06/2021, 18:30:55] Sabrina: Went to cinnel today
It‚Äôs crazy expensive
[17/06/2021, 18:30:56] Sabrina: Also
[17/06/2021, 18:31:02] Sabrina: How are you and mom and dad doing
[19/06/2021, 20:05:16] Sabrina: Hope you‚Äôre ok
[21/06/2021, 18:36:46] Sabrina: I asked Dan
[21/06/2021, 18:36:48] Sabrina: To the dance
[21/06/2021, 18:36:53] Sabrina: Waiting to see what he says
[21/07/2021, 20:13:25] Sabrina: Hey lamb chop 
From the bottom of my heart I hope you‚Äôre okay
From the top of my heart I hope mom and dad and Caleb and sparkles are okay too
Signed pork chop
[21/07/2021, 20:29:15] ~Talia‚ú®: Hey, we‚Äôre all okay 
I hope you‚Äôre good too 

I can‚Äôt lie to you and say we‚Äôre all good because for a long time I was really upset about how you treated me. I‚Äôm very much over it now because I did everything I could. For weeks on end I tried to speak to you, phone you and do everything in between to check on you because I was worried sick. You chose not to respond because things ‚Äúwere going well‚Äù for you and that was your decision. Yet when you were ready to speak, you phoned, messaged and everything in between. I didn‚Äôt find it fair that when it was convenient for you, we spoke. 
I just needed to know you were okay, I was worried sick. 
I‚Äôm not worried about who you spend time with or who you go out with whenever you go out. That‚Äôs your own business. 
I just didn‚Äôt find what you did fair, especially considering how much time we spent and everything we did together.
[21/07/2021, 22:41:37] Sabrina: ‚ÄéYou deleted this message.
[21/07/2021, 22:55:54] Sabrina: Okay I‚Äôm gonna try this again
I‚Äôm sorry. You‚Äôre right, this has been incredibly unfair to you and there‚Äôs no denying that. I‚Äôm not gonna try justify every little thing that happened to me because that‚Äôs not what I believe in. But I do hope you‚Äôll understand what I have to say next.

There was a bit of a misunderstanding. When I said ‚Äòthings are working out‚Äô I didn‚Äôt mean everything else going on in my life. Because all that was actually the opposite. I was talking about us. I‚Äôve never had a friendship becoming as important as the one that was forming between us, and the clearer the realisation the more I panicked. I know it‚Äôs completely idiotic but there were times when I would think to myself, ‚Äúthings are going so well that I know im gonna fuck things up. There‚Äôs been a bit of a pattern in that area.‚Äù But then the next thought would be ‚Äújust don‚Äôt mess up. Talia means everything and just don‚Äôt mess up.‚Äù And obviously that didn‚Äôt pan out.  I‚Äôm sorry you interpreted it the way you did, by no means was it intentional. 

Granted the timing wasn‚Äôt the greatest on my side, and I know everyone fights demons everyday but I just remembered at the time it felt as it my last string had snapped and I just couldn‚Äôt handle it. The good news is that I have my own Tamara now but she gives me happy pills that make me sleepy :)

I screwed up and I‚Äôm sorry. I just really tried not to give my baggage to you because I know you had your own baggage to carry so much so that I really really screwed the pooch. I don‚Äôt exactly know what happens now, but I hope the sky‚Äôs a bit clearer for you now
[21/07/2021, 22:57:16] Sabrina: The whole ‚Äòthere‚Äôs two sides to every story‚Äô is something I believe in.
I‚Äôm glad I got yours and I hope you get mine
[21/07/2021, 22:58:13] Sabrina: Also uh my mom and brother and everyone else in the world doesn‚Äôt know about the psychiatrist thing so if you could, please could you keep it between us :)
[22/07/2021, 10:50:33] ~Talia‚ú®: I‚Äôll always try understand. 

I thought everything else was going right and I was so upset because I was there when you were going through it and then when you weren‚Äôt. I wasn‚Äôt. 
I haven‚Äôt had a friendship like this either which is why I was so upset. I was upset for weeks. You were my only genuine friend. 

I just don‚Äôt understand why you didn‚Äôt come speak to me. Or at least communicate with me in some way. I see you having the time of your life with Kalista and the moment I try to speak to you, you went cold. 

Your very own Tamara. That‚Äôs good. 

It‚Äôs okay, I just don‚Äôt understand why you couldn‚Äôt come and speak to me but instead chose to lie to me and tell me everything‚Äôs fine when I knew it wasn‚Äôt.
[22/07/2021, 10:50:50] ~Talia‚ú®: How‚Äôd you end up going if they don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre going?
[22/07/2021, 17:06:24] Sabrina: I‚Äôm not gonna lie to you I did try. Not to tell you everything was going to shit but just to spend time with my friend you know. Went to runge more than a couple times and again timing just wasn‚Äôt right. It‚Äôs not your fault though, you also had a lot going on. From what I could see and what I knew, which probably wasn‚Äôt even the half of it. Also Caleb wasn‚Äôt having the time of his life and he was fighting with his parents and it was one of those cases where you couldn‚Äôt do much to help him and I was really concerned for the both of you. It‚Äôs also beyond unfair to dump my baggage on you when you had all that going on already. Plus, im self sufficient in a almost destructive sense I suppose ‚ò∫Ô∏è  I missed speaking to my friend man. Even if you say you can take it I know in my heart that not telling you would be so much more mentally healthier for you in a sense. That week when you said you couldn‚Äôt handle it anymore was scary. I knew at some point there was a bit of a miscommunication between us but I wasn‚Äôt in the right mind state to fix everything. Seb used to tell me tales of the chaos Lara went through so I sort of prepared myself for it. The only thing that still weighed on my mind was that you had to go through the past few months ‚Äòalone‚Äô in a sense and I don‚Äôt know how you were doing. But anyways
[22/07/2021, 17:07:56] Sabrina: Online meets
[22/07/2021, 17:24:58] ~Talia‚ú®: I did have a lot going on, I always do. Caleb and I have gone through it. But you know what didn‚Äôt help, knowing everytime I asked if you were okay you straight up lied to my face saying you were. You were insistent that you were fine. 

I‚Äôm also self sufficient, it doesn‚Äôt mean you weren‚Äôt important or that I wasn‚Äôt worried sick. 
You not telling me caused me so much more damage than telling me. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair that you decide what‚Äôs good for me. 

I know you weren‚Äôt in the state of mind to fix it. I forgive you for not fixing it. 
I just want you to know I grieved that loss. 

I was on my own. I am on my own. I‚Äôll probably always be on my own because that‚Äôs how life works out for me. I don‚Äôt have a friend anymore and it is what it is
[22/07/2021, 17:25:08] ~Talia‚ú®: And paying for it?
[22/07/2021, 17:38:36] Sabrina: The lying was more for myself than it was for you

Regardless, it was a call that I made and I‚Äôm sorry if you disagree but I stand by it

I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs much I can say to that so if that‚Äôs the decision you‚Äôve made then so be it
[22/07/2021, 17:38:47] Sabrina: I‚Äôm fairly financially responsible
[22/07/2021, 17:47:46] ~Talia‚ú®: I understand that. I just wish I could‚Äôve been there for you 

You really hurt me. You were my person.
[22/07/2021, 17:47:58] ~Talia‚ú®: Better than me 
That‚Äôs for sure
[25/07/2021, 16:38:24] Sabrina: God these are ugly
[25/07/2021, 16:39:35] ~Talia‚ú®: Disgustingly so.
[25/07/2021, 16:40:06] ~Talia‚ú®: I was hoping Michelo or someone would submit something
[25/07/2021, 16:40:10] Sabrina: Why?? I thought Camille would design something
[25/07/2021, 16:40:15] Sabrina: Yeah I thought so too
[25/07/2021, 16:40:17] ~Talia‚ú®: THOSE ARE CAMILLE‚Äôs
[25/07/2021, 16:40:26] Sabrina: I had a couple but I figured they‚Äôd do better than me
[25/07/2021, 16:40:32] Sabrina: Fuck no
[25/07/2021, 16:40:38] ~Talia‚ú®: Fuck yes
[25/07/2021, 16:42:05] ~Talia‚ú®: Send me your designs

[25/07/2021, 19:33:11] Sabrina: Do you have a text list of everyone in our grades‚Äô names?

[29/10/2021, 18:31:37] ~Talia‚ú®: Does it really
[29/10/2021, 18:32:09] Sabrina: What if it‚Äôs a metaphorical heartbreak

[05/11/2021, 12:58:45] Sabrina: Our roles reversed hehe
[05/11/2021, 13:17:50] ~Talia‚ú®: Definitely
[07/11/2021, 10:15:33] Sabrina: Can I tell you something
[07/11/2021, 10:15:33] Sabrina: Since you‚Äôre the only person that‚Äôll understand
[07/11/2021, 10:25:49] ~Talia‚ú®: Yes
[07/11/2021, 10:26:07] ~Talia‚ú®: Why are you forwarding my own messages to meüòÇüòÇ
[07/11/2021, 15:02:53] Sabrina: Cause it seemed easiest üòÅ
[07/11/2021, 15:03:29] Sabrina: The divorce is official
[07/11/2021, 15:04:00] Sabrina: And it‚Äôs real tense in the house
And my grandpa wants to move away
[07/11/2021, 15:06:21] ~Talia‚ú®: Oh my god
[07/11/2021, 15:06:35] ~Talia‚ú®: Why‚Äôs it tense 
And why does he want to move away?
[07/11/2021, 15:06:41] ~Talia‚ú®: Where would he move?
[07/11/2021, 15:07:37] Sabrina: Yeah
He wants to quit his job and move back home
It‚Äôs causing a bunch of financial issues 
Seb isn‚Äôt handling it well
[07/11/2021, 15:07:47] Sabrina: He‚Äôs mad at everyone and wants to go to China
[07/11/2021, 15:08:10] Sabrina: Like screaming fits until 3 in the morning mad
[07/11/2021, 15:08:13] ~Talia‚ú®: Why does he want to quit? 
I can imagine, it‚Äôs a loss of income 
Is he not handling it well because of uni?
[07/11/2021, 15:08:22] ~Talia‚ú®: Why‚Äôs he mad at everyone?
[07/11/2021, 15:08:27] ~Talia‚ú®: Oh jesus.
[07/11/2021, 15:09:02] Sabrina: He‚Äôs been unhappy for years
I‚Äôm not too sure about seb, he‚Äôs never wanted to discuss it before
But I imagine that‚Äôs gotta be part of it
[07/11/2021, 15:09:45] Sabrina: Very traditional guy
Says he‚Äôs the ‚Äòman of the household‚Äô
Butts head with my dad and thinks my mom is gonna back him but then she didn‚Äôt
[07/11/2021, 15:10:02] Sabrina: It was hectic yesterday 
They were throwing rocks around in the house
[07/11/2021, 15:10:14] ~Talia‚ú®: So he wants to just not work? 
It‚Äôs hard to discuss things like that though
[07/11/2021, 15:10:38] ~Talia‚ú®: Okay I understand that.
So why don‚Äôt they let him move?
[07/11/2021, 15:10:48] ~Talia‚ú®: Rocks? 
My god
[07/11/2021, 15:10:53] Sabrina: Pretty much
My mom says she‚Äôs fine with the divorce, but not with the lack of income from his part
[07/11/2021, 15:11:13] ~Talia‚ú®: He can‚Äôt just be a stay at home divorced manüòÇ
[07/11/2021, 15:11:38] Sabrina: Cause it‚Äôs not that easy
It‚Äôs gonna cost about half a mil now just for the plane ticket and quarantine
[07/11/2021, 15:11:52] ~Talia‚ú®: Oh shit
[07/11/2021, 15:11:59] ~Talia‚ú®: I forgot about quarantine and shit
[07/11/2021, 15:12:02] Sabrina: Yeah life‚Äôs gone to shit
[07/11/2021, 15:12:08] ~Talia‚ú®: Has someone tried to explain that?
[07/11/2021, 15:12:26] Sabrina: Sort of
[07/11/2021, 15:12:41] Sabrina: That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs kinda like a maze with no way out right now
[07/11/2021, 15:12:43] ~Talia‚ú®: I can see sis 
Do you need anything? 
Do you need to stay here?
[07/11/2021, 15:13:12] ~Talia‚ú®: Don‚Äôt be afraid to alex
[07/11/2021, 15:13:12] Sabrina: Honestly I have no idea what to do 
I need to help my mom
[07/11/2021, 15:13:14] ~Talia‚ú®: Ask*^

[07/11/2021, 15:13:51] Sabrina: She‚Äôs gonna burn out if she hasn‚Äôt by now
[07/11/2021, 15:14:13] Sabrina: I realised yesterday, that she works two jobs and teaches for 20 hours a week on top of that
[07/11/2021, 15:14:20] Sabrina: And that‚Äôs just for seb
[07/11/2021, 15:14:26] ~Talia‚ú®: Yeah that too
[07/11/2021, 15:14:39] ~Talia‚ú®: Do you want to teach?
[07/11/2021, 15:14:58] Sabrina: Fuck no i hate it 
But yeah I‚Äôm gonna have to üòÇ
[07/11/2021, 15:15:18] ~Talia‚ú®: Oh
[07/11/2021, 15:15:23] ~Talia‚ú®: How was maths btw?
[07/11/2021, 15:15:24] Sabrina: Mom says she‚Äôs gonna have to move
[07/11/2021, 15:15:33] ~Talia‚ú®: Tweedledoofus said you didn‚Äôt like it
[07/11/2021, 15:15:34] Sabrina: She loves this house so much
[07/11/2021, 15:15:43] Sabrina: Pure 3?
[07/11/2021, 15:15:47] ~Talia‚ú®: She does
[07/11/2021, 15:15:49] ~Talia‚ú®: Yes
[07/11/2021, 15:16:01] ~Talia‚ú®: Yk
[07/11/2021, 15:16:09] Sabrina: He says a lot of things
I walked out fairly happy and he sort of shut that down
[07/11/2021, 15:16:24] Sabrina: It was better than pure 1 üòÇ
[07/11/2021, 15:16:43] ~Talia‚ú®: I think the best thing you can do maybe
Is wait this year and start uni the following year, to give her some time
[07/11/2021, 15:17:08] ~Talia‚ú®: He said after you asked Caroline you came back 
He does say a lot of things. Hurtful things too 

Btw he considered you very impartial
[07/11/2021, 15:17:07] Sabrina: That‚Äôs the thing though
Uni is slowly moving out of the picture
[07/11/2021, 15:17:22] ~Talia‚ú®: Wdym slowly moving out? 
Like fully?
[07/11/2021, 15:17:27] ~Talia‚ú®: Really?
[07/11/2021, 15:17:48] Sabrina: Yeah the asking Caroline humbled me üòÇ
But I still feel good 
Fingers crossed
[07/11/2021, 15:17:57] ~Talia‚ú®: I‚Äôm glad sis
[07/11/2021, 15:18:03] Sabrina: It‚Äôs a possibility
[07/11/2021, 15:18:05] ~Talia‚ú®: He came home so downüòÇ
[07/11/2021, 15:18:11] ~Talia‚ú®: Mom was trynna comfort him
[07/11/2021, 15:18:17] ~Talia‚ú®: So then what are you gonna do?
[07/11/2021, 15:18:17] Sabrina: Shame but I think he puts a lot of pressure on himself
[07/11/2021, 15:18:21] ~Talia‚ú®: Why don‚Äôt you go to SA?
[07/11/2021, 15:18:29] ~Talia‚ú®: Ofc he does
Especially with maths
[07/11/2021, 15:18:38] Sabrina: Yeah I can imagine
[07/11/2021, 15:18:57] Sabrina: No idea
[07/11/2021, 15:19:03] ~Talia‚ú®: He said his A is out the window
[07/11/2021, 15:19:05] Sabrina: Shame man
[07/11/2021, 15:19:14] ~Talia‚ú®: I don‚Äôt think mom will let you not go
[07/11/2021, 15:19:14] Sabrina: No he‚Äôs underestimating grade boundaries
[07/11/2021, 15:19:29] ~Talia‚ú®: But you know my mom 
She‚Äôs horrible at comforting
[07/11/2021, 15:19:32] Sabrina: Cause she feels guilty if I go to wits and seb‚Äôs in the uk
[07/11/2021, 15:19:41] Sabrina: So I think her plan is just to make me wait
[07/11/2021, 15:19:49] Sabrina: üòÇ it‚Äôs sweet that she tried
[07/11/2021, 15:19:52] ~Talia‚ú®: Yeah we have our fingers crossed
[07/11/2021, 15:20:12] ~Talia‚ú®: She didn‚Äôt really she kinda she said it‚Äôs done, don‚Äôt dwell
[07/11/2021, 15:20:37] ~Talia‚ú®: Would you feel mad that he‚Äôs going to the UK and you‚Äôre in SA?
[07/11/2021, 15:20:38] Sabrina: Well isn‚Äôt that just what ya wanna hear
[07/11/2021, 15:20:49] ~Talia‚ú®: Not really
[07/11/2021, 15:20:54] Sabrina: Absolutely not
[07/11/2021, 15:21:00] Sabrina: It‚Äôs more of a course issue
[07/11/2021, 15:21:26] ~Talia‚ú®: Why don‚Äôt you study com sci?
[07/11/2021, 15:21:33] ~Talia‚ú®: So maybe communicate that with her
[07/11/2021, 15:21:45] Sabrina: Probably will
[07/11/2021, 15:21:50] ~Talia‚ú®: That‚Äô you‚Äôre comfortable with staying in SA
[07/11/2021, 15:22:18] ~Talia‚ú®: And she shouldn‚Äôt feel guilty that he‚Äôs in the UK
And that you‚Äôre happy that at least Seb gets to be there
[07/11/2021, 15:22:44] Sabrina: It‚Äôs gonna be irregardless of what I say though
[07/11/2021, 15:22:46] Sabrina: Part of it at least
[07/11/2021, 15:23:14] ~Talia‚ú®: No I understand that
[07/11/2021, 15:23:17] ~Talia‚ú®: But at least voice it
[07/11/2021, 15:23:23] ~Talia‚ú®: Don‚Äôt assume it won‚Äôt have any impact
[07/11/2021, 15:23:30] Sabrina: Honestly seeing everyone in your family cry is something else
[07/11/2021, 15:23:30] ~Talia‚ú®: Just so it‚Äôs out there
[07/11/2021, 15:23:40] Sabrina: My dad‚Äôs making briyani üòÇ

[07/11/2021, 15:24:39] Sabrina: Third degree burns on his legs and foot
[07/11/2021, 15:24:48] Sabrina: He‚Äôs at home until it heals
[07/11/2021, 15:25:06] Sabrina: And all just because I‚Äôm done with school
[07/11/2021, 15:25:22] Sabrina: I think I‚Äôm good

[07/11/2021, 15:26:24] ~Talia‚ú®: Definitely a bittersweet moment
[07/11/2021, 15:26:28] ~Talia‚ú®: My god
[07/11/2021, 15:26:36] Sabrina: He didn‚Äôt specify but the machines he works with are really hot
[07/11/2021, 15:26:44] Sabrina: So I‚Äôm assuming human error
[07/11/2021, 15:26:50] ~Talia‚ú®: I would assume so
[07/11/2021, 15:26:59] ~Talia‚ú®: Yk I‚Äôm always here right

[07/11/2021, 15:27:42] Sabrina: Even though I‚Äôm sorta bombarding this one üòÇ
[07/11/2021, 15:27:53] ~Talia‚ú®: Wdym?
[07/11/2021, 15:27:55] Sabrina: Aw

[07/11/2021, 15:28:20] ~Talia‚ú®: I got a dress! 
And it was really pretty
[07/11/2021, 15:28:23] ~Talia‚ú®: And cheap too
[07/11/2021, 15:28:31] Sabrina: Nice!!
[07/11/2021, 15:28:33] ~Talia‚ú®: I‚Äôm also very sad recently
[07/11/2021, 15:28:33] Sabrina: Fancy dress?
[07/11/2021, 15:28:36] Sabrina: Oh no
[07/11/2021, 15:28:40] Sabrina: Why?
[07/11/2021, 15:28:43] ~Talia‚ú®: Sort of but not too fancy
[07/11/2021, 15:28:54] ~Talia‚ú®: I feel very disconnected from everything
[07/11/2021, 15:28:59] ~Talia‚ú®: And I‚Äôm very emotional
[07/11/2021, 15:29:17] ~Talia‚ú®: And Tweedledoofus has just said some horrible stuff over the last couple days
[07/11/2021, 15:29:24] Sabrina: Dude exam mood swings are such a thing 
I don‚Äôt know if you get it too
[07/11/2021, 15:29:24] ~Talia‚ú®: So I‚Äôm working on not taking it personally
[07/11/2021, 15:29:31] ~Talia‚ú®: Yes. I do
[07/11/2021, 15:29:38] Sabrina: What a bitch üò†
[07/11/2021, 15:29:41] ~Talia‚ú®: So yeah 
I‚Äôm really sad
[07/11/2021, 15:29:44] Sabrina: Yeah try to
[07/11/2021, 15:29:53] Sabrina: Gah damnit
[07/11/2021, 15:29:58] Sabrina: Talking to Tamara?
[07/11/2021, 15:30:04] ~Talia‚ú®: He said I should be grateful he chose me but he isn‚Äôt grateful I chose him because he‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs first choice anyway
[07/11/2021, 15:30:10] ~Talia‚ú®: Yes 
A lot
[07/11/2021, 15:30:17] ~Talia‚ú®: I cried in therapy this week
[07/11/2021, 15:30:26] Sabrina: Oof 
That choice of words
I do not like them
[07/11/2021, 15:30:45] Sabrina: God it‚Äôs whole new issues now
[07/11/2021, 15:30:49] ~Talia‚ú®: He doesn‚Äôt realise what he says 
And I said go ask someone you consider impartial and see if they see a problem with that
[07/11/2021, 15:30:53] Sabrina: I sorta hoped they‚Äôd simmer down after high school
[07/11/2021, 15:31:00] ~Talia‚ú®: Me too
[07/11/2021, 15:31:25] ~Talia‚ú®: I also told him I‚Äôm tired of hearing about his past lifestyle and I hate when he spends 45 mins talking about himself
[07/11/2021, 15:31:25] Sabrina: Ugh
[07/11/2021, 15:31:35] ~Talia‚ú®: Which he labeled as you
[07/11/2021, 15:31:58] Sabrina: Is part of this him being tense from exams?
[07/11/2021, 15:32:03] Sabrina: Not that it justifies it of course
[07/11/2021, 15:32:08] Sabrina: Oh no no no no no
[07/11/2021, 15:32:08] ~Talia‚ú®: No he‚Äôs just always been like that
[07/11/2021, 15:32:11] ~Talia‚ú®: Yk him
[07/11/2021, 15:32:18] ~Talia‚ú®: He loves to talk about himself.
[07/11/2021, 15:32:23] Sabrina: I was really hoping there was another reason
[07/11/2021, 15:32:36] ~Talia‚ú®: Yeah which I found great because any rational person would agree that what he said was fucked up.
[07/11/2021, 15:32:48] Sabrina: What are you gonna do?
[07/11/2021, 15:32:58] Sabrina: Did you tell him off?
[07/11/2021, 15:33:11] ~Talia‚ú®: I was basically screaming
[07/11/2021, 15:33:15] ~Talia‚ú®: I did
[07/11/2021, 15:33:19] Sabrina: Good on you
[07/11/2021, 15:33:20] ~Talia‚ú®: But I was just so hurt Yk
[07/11/2021, 15:33:24] ~Talia‚ú®: He made me sound so less than him
[07/11/2021, 15:33:27] ~Talia‚ú®: And honestly
[07/11/2021, 15:33:30] ~Talia‚ú®: He‚Äôs lucky to have me.
[07/11/2021, 15:33:30] Sabrina: Yeah ofc it‚Äôs a terrible thing to say
[07/11/2021, 15:33:35] Sabrina: That‚Äôs the thing though
[07/11/2021, 15:33:37] Sabrina: That‚Äôs exactly it
[07/11/2021, 15:33:41] ~Talia‚ú®: I‚Äôm a flex of a girlfriend
[07/11/2021, 15:33:49] Sabrina: He‚Äôs got some sort of superiority complex and it‚Äôs annoying
[07/11/2021, 15:34:00] ~Talia‚ú®: Like he doesn‚Äôt realise that because I‚Äôm not blonde with blue eyes
[07/11/2021, 15:34:09] ~Talia‚ú®: It‚Äôs such a terrible thing
[07/11/2021, 15:34:13] ~Talia‚ú®: But I also know it‚Äôs not true
[07/11/2021, 15:34:24] ~Talia‚ú®: Because he should be fucking grateful that I chose him
[07/11/2021, 15:34:29] ~Talia‚ú®: And continue to choose him.
[07/11/2021, 15:34:38] Sabrina: And you shouldn‚Äôt have to tell him that for him to know
[07/11/2021, 15:34:50] ~Talia‚ú®: Giving
[07/11/2021, 15:34:53] ~Talia‚ú®: Right*^^
[07/11/2021, 15:35:00] Sabrina: I‚Äôm sorry
[07/11/2021, 15:35:01] ~Talia‚ú®: You agree with me?
[07/11/2021, 15:35:10] Sabrina: No shit üòÇ
[07/11/2021, 15:35:19] ~Talia‚ú®: I appreciate it
[07/11/2021, 15:35:28] ~Talia‚ú®: I‚Äôm going to be real ugly rn
[07/11/2021, 15:35:31] Sabrina: What kind of person says ‚Äòyou should be grateful‚Äô
[07/11/2021, 15:35:30] ~Talia‚ú®: But it‚Äôs you
[07/11/2021, 15:35:34] ~Talia‚ú®: So I know it‚Äôs confidential
[07/11/2021, 15:35:39] Sabrina: Yeah always
[07/11/2021, 15:35:46] ~Talia‚ú®: But I took the fuckboy
[07/11/2021, 15:35:52] ~Talia‚ú®: Dealt with his whored
[07/11/2021, 15:35:55] ~Talia‚ú®: Whores
[07/11/2021, 15:36:04] ~Talia‚ú®: I was literally dragged through the mud
[07/11/2021, 15:36:14] ~Talia‚ú®: Called horrible names by his parents
[07/11/2021, 15:36:28] ~Talia‚ú®: Dealt with him being emotionally unavailable
[07/11/2021, 15:36:42] ~Talia‚ú®: Dealt with his ego which makes me feel like there‚Äôs 3 people in the relationship
[07/11/2021, 15:36:49] ~Talia‚ú®: Dealt with his shitty as fuck friends
[07/11/2021, 15:36:55] ~Talia‚ú®: BUT I MUST BE GRATEFUL?
[07/11/2021, 15:36:59] ~Talia‚ú®: He does
[07/11/2021, 15:37:10] Sabrina: Is it still worth it?
[07/11/2021, 15:37:16] ~Talia‚ú®: I would‚Äôve been okay if he said I‚Äôm grateful you chose me too. 
That‚Äôs different
[07/11/2021, 15:37:33] Sabrina: Yeah it would be
[07/11/2021, 15:37:36] ~Talia‚ú®: Rn tbh 
No. 
Nothing is worth feeling less than what you are
[07/11/2021, 15:37:53] ~Talia‚ú®: But I also know I‚Äôm the flex between us yk
[07/11/2021, 15:37:58] Sabrina: Do you think in the long run it‚Äôll be worth it?
[07/11/2021, 15:38:12] Sabrina: No kidding
[07/11/2021, 15:38:16] ~Talia‚ú®: If he comes around yes
[07/11/2021, 15:38:19] ~Talia‚ú®: You‚Äôre bias.
[07/11/2021, 15:38:29] ~Talia‚ú®: If he doesn‚Äôt
Then he might have to do this on his own
[07/11/2021, 15:38:34] Sabrina: I‚Äôve been dubbed impartial üòÅ
[07/11/2021, 15:38:44] ~Talia‚ú®: I value myself enough to not be taken for less than him.
[07/11/2021, 15:38:44] Sabrina: How long has it been?
[07/11/2021, 15:38:53] ~Talia‚ú®: It‚Äôs always been like this sis
[07/11/2021, 15:39:01] ~Talia‚ú®: Yeah but still
[07/11/2021, 15:39:03] ~Talia‚ú®: In general
[07/11/2021, 15:39:08] Sabrina: Just always remember that
[07/11/2021, 15:39:11] ~Talia‚ú®: I honestly think people like me more
[07/11/2021, 15:39:22] Sabrina: But you said he doesn‚Äôt realise he‚Äôs wrong?
[07/11/2021, 15:39:25] ~Talia‚ú®: Not huns because all they wanna do is fuck him
[07/11/2021, 15:39:28] ~Talia‚ú®: No he doesn‚Äôt.
[07/11/2021, 15:39:32] ~Talia‚ú®: He saw no problem with it
[07/11/2021, 15:39:33] Sabrina: Again
No kidding üòÇ
[07/11/2021, 15:39:46] ~Talia‚ú®: No he‚Äôs convinced people don‚Äôt like me and think I‚Äôm a brat
[07/11/2021, 15:39:57] ~Talia‚ú®: He says everyone likes him more
[07/11/2021, 15:39:57] Sabrina: How fucking ironic
[07/11/2021, 15:40:05] ~Talia‚ú®: I mean right.
[07/11/2021, 15:40:21] ~Talia‚ú®: But no one can tell him shit
And he was like people love hearing about me
[07/11/2021, 15:40:28] ~Talia‚ú®: It‚Äôs different if it‚Äôs one conversation
[07/11/2021, 15:40:34] Sabrina: Why the fuck should it even matter though
[07/11/2021, 15:40:36] ~Talia‚ú®: When every fucking day you hear the same thing it‚Äôs not.
[07/11/2021, 15:40:51] Sabrina: Yeah it gets real annoying real quick
[07/11/2021, 15:41:04] ~Talia‚ú®: It doesn‚Äôt
He just loves to point out that I‚Äôm ungrateful and full of attitude.
[07/11/2021, 15:41:10] ~Talia‚ú®: He doesn‚Äôt realise that
[07/11/2021, 15:41:24] Sabrina: Do you think he‚Äôll come around?
[07/11/2021, 15:41:43] ~Talia‚ú®: I need to speak to him when his walls are down
[07/11/2021, 15:42:24] ~Talia‚ú®: We had such a raw and open conversation a couple weeks back and I just feel like we moved 10 steps forward
[07/11/2021, 15:42:27] ~Talia‚ú®: It was so eye opening
[07/11/2021, 15:42:39] Sabrina: Aw progress!
[07/11/2021, 15:42:47] Sabrina: Development
[07/11/2021, 15:42:47] ~Talia‚ú®: But then his walls went back up
[07/11/2021, 15:42:52] ~Talia‚ú®: So it was counterproductive
[07/11/2021, 15:43:00] ~Talia‚ú®: But I learnt a lot from that one conversation
[07/11/2021, 15:43:13] ~Talia‚ú®: I‚Äôm hoping to catch him on the 20th when we sleepover
[07/11/2021, 15:43:27] Sabrina: I know you‚Äôve waited a really long time already but I think things will get better after high school
[07/11/2021, 15:43:39] ~Talia‚ú®: I saw a glimpse of hope Yk
[07/11/2021, 15:43:47] ~Talia‚ú®: And that‚Äôs what makes me stick around
[07/11/2021, 15:43:53] ~Talia‚ú®: It always gets better
[07/11/2021, 15:43:56] Sabrina: I think there‚Äôs hope
[07/11/2021, 15:44:05] Sabrina: I think if anyone has any chance of changing him it‚Äôs you
[07/11/2021, 15:44:06] ~Talia‚ú®: I just don‚Äôt know how long I can take it
[07/11/2021, 15:44:16] ~Talia‚ú®: He‚Äôs so just self centered
[07/11/2021, 15:44:24] ~Talia‚ú®: I feel like it‚Äôs my feelings vs his ego
[07/11/2021, 15:44:40] Sabrina: Honestly it‚Äôs been this since the start
[07/11/2021, 15:44:46] ~Talia‚ú®: Exactly
[07/11/2021, 15:44:49] ~Talia‚ú®: Yk
[07/11/2021, 15:44:52] ~Talia‚ú®: The hardest part is
[07/11/2021, 15:45:01] ~Talia‚ú®: I got an apology for this not long ago
[07/11/2021, 15:45:06] ~Talia‚ú®: And it‚Äôs just the same shit
[07/11/2021, 15:45:15] ~Talia‚ú®: Another ugly comment
[07/11/2021, 15:45:44] ~Talia‚ú®: I think I‚Äôm one of the only people capable of dealing with him on such an intimate level
But he‚Äôs not the only man capable of dealing with me.
[07/11/2021, 15:46:01] Sabrina: At least his apologies are sincere (I think) even if he retracts into his old ways
[07/11/2021, 15:46:05] ~Talia‚ú®: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been doing some deep thinking and tbh I don‚Äôt like the person I‚Äôve become. I‚Äôm not gonna tell you that you deserve better but instead I wanna become better to deserve you. I‚Äôm sorry for all my ego and arrogance has put you through and I‚Äôm gonna try my best to change. Thanks for putting up with all my shit and once again I‚Äôm sorry for upsetting you‚Äù
[07/11/2021, 15:46:28] ~Talia‚ú®: They are
 He just never apologises
I have to kick and scream 95% of the time
[07/11/2021, 15:46:40] Sabrina: That‚Äôs fair
[07/11/2021, 15:46:40] ~Talia‚ú®: Sis 
He can‚Äôt take criticism 
He gets so pissed off
[07/11/2021, 15:47:08] Sabrina: As long as it‚Äôs still worth it
[07/11/2021, 15:47:26] ~Talia‚ú®: In this very moment
It isn‚Äôt.
[07/11/2021, 15:47:38] ~Talia‚ú®: So yeah
[07/11/2021, 15:47:45] Sabrina: Again, if anyone has shot of changing him, it‚Äôs you 
It kinda sucks , and it‚Äôs extremely unfair on you , but it‚Äôs what it is
[07/11/2021, 15:47:59] ~Talia‚ú®: I‚Äôm not crazy for feeling how I feel right
[07/11/2021, 15:48:03] Sabrina: Honest question
Would you ever give up on him?
[07/11/2021, 15:48:07] Sabrina: Not at all
[07/11/2021, 15:48:24] ~Talia‚ú®: Like I‚Äôm not being unreasonable by saying I‚Äôm tired of hearing him speak about himself
[07/11/2021, 15:48:24] Sabrina: I don‚Äôt how you‚Äôre putting up with it and I dont know how you‚Äôve been putting up with it for so long
[07/11/2021, 15:48:39] ~Talia‚ú®: And then I said you never ask me anything
And he goes ‚Äúoh I didn‚Äôt know you needed a therapist‚Äù
[07/11/2021, 15:49:01] Sabrina: And honestly sometimes the relationship isn‚Äôt healthy at all but when I ask you if it‚Äôs worth it you‚Äôve stuck by the answer yes so I‚Äôve backed off
[07/11/2021, 15:49:21] ~Talia‚ú®: I‚Äôve been very close to 
I don‚Äôt think I mentally could
But I think he might take Everything from me and I have no choice but to
[07/11/2021, 15:49:28] Sabrina: Oh go
[07/11/2021, 15:49:30] Sabrina: God
[07/11/2021, 15:49:41] ~Talia‚ú®: I don‚Äôt know either tbh
[07/11/2021, 15:49:48] ~Talia‚ú®: I‚Äôm honestly built different
[07/11/2021, 15:49:54] Sabrina: I don‚Äôt blame you
[07/11/2021, 15:49:55] ~Talia‚ú®: And I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm strong or weak
[07/11/2021, 15:50:06] Sabrina: It‚Äôs a valid question
[07/11/2021, 15:50:16] ~Talia‚ú®: Yeah but I‚Äôm questioning that worth now
[07/11/2021, 15:50:22] ~Talia‚ú®: What does he give me anymore?
[07/11/2021, 15:50:27] ~Talia‚ú®: Genuinely and truly
[07/11/2021, 15:50:29] Sabrina: Do you think he‚Äôs capable of change?
[07/11/2021, 15:50:40] ~Talia‚ú®: I think he‚Äôs capable of it
Because I‚Äôve seen it
[07/11/2021, 15:50:46] Sabrina: That You‚Äôve got to answer for yourself
[07/11/2021, 15:50:47] ~Talia‚ú®: I just don‚Äôt know when he‚Äôll realise that
[07/11/2021, 15:50:53] ~Talia‚ú®: I don‚Äôt know
[07/11/2021, 15:51:15] Sabrina: And the shitty thing is
No matter how many times other people tell him, he has to realise it for himself
[07/11/2021, 15:51:17] ~Talia‚ú®: These past 2-3 weeks I just feel so drained
[07/11/2021, 15:51:23] ~Talia‚ú®: That‚Äôs the thing
[07/11/2021, 15:51:43] Sabrina: Comfort ? Love? Support ?
[07/11/2021, 15:51:44] ~Talia‚ú®: And the one person that actually criticises him 
He can‚Äôt take that criticism
[07/11/2021, 15:52:21] Sabrina: He‚Äôs been coddled since god knows how long and you might just be the first person who‚Äôs slapped him in the face with reality and still stuck around after that
[07/11/2021, 15:52:45] ~Talia‚ú®: Comfort he isn‚Äôt compassionate which I‚Äôve recently learnt 
Love, yes always. But a lot of people can give me love 
Support, yes but like I‚Äôve said. Many people in my life have given me support
[07/11/2021, 15:52:50] ~Talia‚ú®: Yk what the worst thing is
[07/11/2021, 15:53:02] ~Talia‚ú®: I think Adam has given me more emotional support than Caleb has
[07/11/2021, 15:53:11] Sabrina: Oofie
[07/11/2021, 15:53:14] ~Talia‚ú®: And he hates it
He loses his shit with me
[07/11/2021, 15:53:20] Sabrina: Well that‚Äôs not great to hear
[07/11/2021, 15:53:22] ~Talia‚ú®: HUGE oofie
[07/11/2021, 15:53:27] ~Talia‚ú®: How pathetic
[07/11/2021, 15:53:42] Sabrina: I hate that he makes you cry
[07/11/2021, 15:54:01] ~Talia‚ú®: Yk how many times I‚Äôve sobbed
[07/11/2021, 15:54:09] ~Talia‚ú®: I sobbed for an entire night about 2 weeks ago
[07/11/2021, 15:54:18] Sabrina: I don‚Äôt think anyone deserves your tears
[07/11/2021, 15:54:23] Sabrina: And yet it happens over and over again
[07/11/2021, 15:54:30] ~Talia‚ú®: I‚Äôm gonna be honest with you. I love you but I always end up hurting you. I‚Äôm not the type of person you should be in a relationship with because I can‚Äôt give you what you need. My mindset has done nothing but harm to you and everything we‚Äôve tried to build. I would call you but I know it wouldn‚Äôt help. It‚Äôs with a heavy heart that I suggest I should take my exit. If we don‚Äôt speak again I want you to know that you were my everything and I‚Äôll always have love for you.
[07/11/2021, 15:54:53] ~Talia‚ú®: You need to stop doing this to yourself. Holding on is hurting you more than letting go. I‚Äôm not good for you and I can‚Äôt give you what you want from a man. I don‚Äôt wanna keep hurting you cause everytime I do it eats away at me too much and soon there‚Äôs gonna be nothing left. If I take my exit I know you‚Äôll be better off eventually, maybe not now but you‚Äôll learn to live without me
[07/11/2021, 15:54:53] ~Talia‚ú®: You‚Äôll be better off in the sense that you won‚Äôt get hurt and you life will be a lot less emotional. 

You were always good enough, I don‚Äôt want to leave you, I want you to stop getting hurt and in order for me to do that I probably have to step out
[07/11/2021, 15:55:03] ~Talia‚ú®: I didn‚Äôt think so either
[07/11/2021, 15:55:07] ~Talia‚ú®: Yet here I am
[07/11/2021, 15:55:12] ~Talia‚ú®: But then again 
I did cry over you too
[07/11/2021, 15:55:19] ~Talia‚ú®: It‚Äôs horrible
[07/11/2021, 15:55:48] Sabrina: Damn
[07/11/2021, 15:55:55] Sabrina: So nothing‚Äôs changed since April
[07/11/2021, 15:56:03] ~Talia‚ú®: Nope
[07/11/2021, 15:56:06] ~Talia‚ú®: Doesn‚Äôt look like it
[07/11/2021, 15:56:10] ~Talia‚ú®: Kinda sad huh
[07/11/2021, 15:56:14] Sabrina: Yeah
[07/11/2021, 15:56:16] Sabrina: Just a lil
[07/11/2021, 15:56:20] ~Talia‚ú®: Maybe he isn‚Äôt built for this lifestyle
[07/11/2021, 15:56:21] Sabrina: It‚Äôs a sobering reality
[07/11/2021, 15:56:28] ~Talia‚ú®: And I need to recognise that
[07/11/2021, 15:56:41] Sabrina: The question is if you‚Äôd still like to stick around
[07/11/2021, 15:57:03] Sabrina: And find out
[07/11/2021, 15:57:04] ~Talia‚ú®: Yk how they say don‚Äôt fall in love with potential
[07/11/2021, 15:57:28] Sabrina: Yeah
‚ÄòDon‚Äôt fall in love with someone you think you can change.‚Äô
[07/11/2021, 15:57:42] ~Talia‚ú®: I don‚Äôt know if I fell in love with potential or if I fell in love with the man that I see when hes guard isn‚Äôt up
[07/11/2021, 15:57:46] Sabrina: ‚ÄòTake them for who they are or don‚Äôt take them at all‚Äô
[07/11/2021, 15:58:02] Sabrina: It‚Äôs definitely different when his walks are down
[07/11/2021, 15:58:16] ~Talia‚ú®: Because the man I see when he doesn‚Äôt have his guard up 
I kid you not
I fall in love over and over again. Every singel time
[07/11/2021, 15:58:19] ~Talia‚ú®: Single**
[07/11/2021, 15:58:26] ~Talia‚ú®: I took him for what he is
[07/11/2021, 15:58:36] ~Talia‚ú®: But I never thought he was so harsh
[07/11/2021, 15:58:40] ~Talia‚ú®: You know Tamara said to me
[07/11/2021, 15:58:48] ~Talia‚ú®: He‚Äôs very very harsh on you Talia
[07/11/2021, 15:58:55] ~Talia‚ú®: And he gaslights me
[07/11/2021, 15:59:17] Sabrina: Damn
I didn‚Äôt know she‚Äôd actually say it
[07/11/2021, 15:59:20] Sabrina: So, so much
[07/11/2021, 15:59:29] Sabrina: Ever since I learnt what gaslighting was
[07/11/2021, 16:00:08] ~Talia‚ú®: Yk one point
[07/11/2021, 16:00:13] ~Talia‚ú®: I literally asked myself
Am I crazy
[07/11/2021, 16:00:21] ~Talia‚ú®: No she said it
[07/11/2021, 16:00:25] ~Talia‚ú®: With her full chest
[07/11/2021, 16:00:46] Sabrina: How did you respond
[07/11/2021, 16:01:16] ~Talia‚ú®: I said I didn‚Äôt know if I was being sensitive
[07/11/2021, 16:01:37] ~Talia‚ú®: I‚Äôve learnt that I can‚Äôt depend on him for a lot of things
[07/11/2021, 16:01:46] ~Talia‚ú®: And I‚Äôm too sensitive
[07/11/2021, 16:02:29] ~Talia‚ú®: Yk I cried for this message. 
I literally sobbed
[07/11/2021, 16:02:44] ~Talia‚ú®: And Yk what hurts me the most
[07/11/2021, 16:03:00] ~Talia‚ú®: He‚Äôs aware of what he does
[07/11/2021, 16:03:06] ~Talia‚ú®: And he knows how I feel
[07/11/2021, 16:03:18] ~Talia‚ú®: Yet instead of trying to be the man I need 
He‚Äôd rather leave
[07/11/2021, 16:03:50] ~Talia‚ú®: And he says he doesn‚Äôt wanna change because then he‚Äôs changing who he is for me and all I do is complain and I‚Äôm ungrateful
[07/11/2021, 16:04:12] Sabrina: Do you want to break up?
[07/11/2021, 16:04:25] ~Talia‚ú®: He‚Äôs got a hold on me sis
[07/11/2021, 16:04:29] ~Talia‚ú®: Idk what it is
[07/11/2021, 16:04:47] ~Talia‚ú®: But I will always gravitate towards him
[07/11/2021, 16:05:01] ~Talia‚ú®: But idk if it‚Äôs because I gravitate towards broken people
[07/11/2021, 16:05:09] ~Talia‚ú®: Or emotionally unattached people
[07/11/2021, 16:05:14] ~Talia‚ú®: Tamara said he‚Äôs like my dad
[07/11/2021, 16:05:19] Sabrina: You know that rose quote
[07/11/2021, 16:05:42] ~Talia‚ú®: Which one
[07/11/2021, 16:05:48] Sabrina: I‚Äôm paraphrasing but something along the lines of 
‚ÄòShe stayed for the rose but got hurt by the thorns each time‚Äô
[07/11/2021, 16:05:55] Sabrina: Oof
[07/11/2021, 16:05:57] Sabrina: Ouch
[07/11/2021, 16:05:59] Sabrina: Daddy issues
[07/11/2021, 16:06:06] ~Talia‚ú®: Oh I‚Äôve never seen it
[07/11/2021, 16:06:21] ~Talia‚ú®: Yk people naturally gravitate to partners that resemble their parents
[07/11/2021, 16:06:25] Sabrina: Yeah

[15/11/2021, 20:01:27] Sabrina: I debated wishing him happy birthday 
But since I‚Äôm out of high school there‚Äôs no chance we‚Äôre keeping in contact
So I didn‚Äôt bother

[07/02/2022, 13:58:54] ~Talia‚ú®: Caleb‚Äôs all disappointed
[07/02/2022, 13:58:56] Sabrina: No no no no no
[07/02/2022, 13:59:03] ~Talia‚ú®: Yesterday night fight
[07/02/2022, 13:59:04] ~Talia‚ú®: Right
[07/02/2022, 13:59:13] ~Talia‚ú®: Oh 
I didn‚Äôt think he was capable
Of that
[07/02/2022, 13:59:16] ~Talia‚ú®: What what what
[07/02/2022, 13:59:27] ~Talia‚ú®: Don‚Äôt know if I can associate with him anymore
[07/02/2022, 13:59:32] ~Talia‚ú®: What what what
[07/02/2022, 13:59:37] ~Talia‚ú®: Poof
[07/02/2022, 13:59:46] ~Talia‚ú®: Going to Josh‚Äôs birthday thing
[07/02/2022, 13:59:53] ~Talia‚ú®: I genuinely am disgusted
[07/02/2022, 14:00:21] Sabrina: I‚Äôm sorry but sexual harassment is my non negotiable line
[07/02/2022, 14:00:28] ~Talia‚ú®: That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying
[07/02/2022, 14:00:33] ~Talia‚ú®: It‚Äôs also my non negotiable
[07/02/2022, 14:00:36] ~Talia‚ú®: Like it‚Äôs the start
[07/02/2022, 14:00:49] ~Talia‚ú®: How could you possibly associate with someone that does shit like that
[07/02/2022, 14:00:52] ~Talia‚ú®: I‚Äôm so pissed
[07/02/2022, 14:00:59] Sabrina: No this is a cut off all ties for me
[07/02/2022, 14:01:03] Sabrina: Regardless of who
[07/02/2022, 14:01:06] Sabrina: God no
[07/02/2022, 14:01:08] ~Talia‚ú®: As in with Josh
[07/02/2022, 14:01:12] Sabrina: Yeah
[07/02/2022, 14:01:16] ~Talia‚ú®: Because I‚Äôm mad at Caleb
[07/02/2022, 14:01:28] Sabrina: Caleb‚Äôs letting it slide?
[07/02/2022, 14:01:33] ~Talia‚ú®: Pissed actually
[07/02/2022, 14:01:37] ~Talia‚ú®: I don‚Äôt know
[07/02/2022, 14:01:45] Sabrina: You have every right
[07/02/2022, 14:01:57] Sabrina: I‚Äôm sorry
[07/02/2022, 14:02:28] ~Talia‚ú®: I just can‚Äôt
[07/02/2022, 14:02:32] ~Talia‚ú®: I‚Äôm genuinely so upset
[07/02/2022, 14:02:34] ~Talia‚ú®: So so upset
[07/02/2022, 14:02:51] ~Talia‚ú®: I don‚Äôt know if I can date a man that is apologetic to this
[07/02/2022, 14:03:13] Sabrina: You‚Äôre gonna have to consider everything
[07/02/2022, 14:03:33] Sabrina: Maybe try talk to him first?
I wanna give him the benefit of the doubt
Somehow
[07/02/2022, 14:04:04] ~Talia‚ú®: Consider what
[07/02/2022, 14:04:11] ~Talia‚ú®: That could‚Äôve been me
[07/02/2022, 14:04:11] Sabrina: Oh his
[07/02/2022, 14:04:15] Sabrina: This*
[07/02/2022, 14:04:27] Sabrina: 1 in 3 hey
[07/02/2022, 14:04:34] ~Talia‚ú®: I‚Äôll express how disgusted I am
[07/02/2022, 14:04:45] Sabrina: This one‚Äôs bad
[07/02/2022, 14:04:57] ~Talia‚ú®: Wdym
Bad
[07/02/2022, 14:05:22] Sabrina: Josh did something bad
Caleb‚Äôs not doing something great either
[07/02/2022, 14:05:32] ~Talia‚ú®: Yeah
[07/02/2022, 14:05:46] Sabrina: Maybe Caleb will come around
[07/02/2022, 14:05:52] ~Talia‚ú®: I‚Äôm genuinely so disappointed in the fact you still choose to associate with Josh knowing what he did
[07/02/2022, 14:05:56] ~Talia‚ú®: That‚Äôs what I wanna say
[07/02/2022, 14:06:08] Sabrina: It‚Äôs basically saying he‚Äôs letting it slide
[07/02/2022, 14:06:14] ~Talia‚ú®: Exactly
[07/02/2022, 14:06:23] Sabrina: Like josh needs to learn consequences
[07/02/2022, 14:06:32] Sabrina: And this isn‚Äôt it
[07/02/2022, 14:06:40] ~Talia‚ú®: Is that okay
[07/02/2022, 14:07:03] Sabrina: It seems a bit of an understatement but it‚Äôs definitely a good start
[07/02/2022, 14:07:10] ~Talia‚ú®: What should I say
[07/02/2022, 14:07:15] Sabrina: No no start with that
[07/02/2022, 14:07:19] Sabrina: See how he responds
[07/02/2022, 14:07:22] ~Talia‚ú®: And then what
[07/02/2022, 14:07:25] Sabrina: Does he know that it‚Äôs a big deal
[07/02/2022, 14:07:29] ~Talia‚ú®: Idk
[07/02/2022, 14:07:32] ~Talia‚ú®: We‚Äôll find out
[07/02/2022, 14:07:49] Sabrina: Idk if he‚Äôs gonna dismiss it
[07/02/2022, 14:07:54] Sabrina: It‚Äôs a sensitive topic
[07/02/2022, 14:07:54] ~Talia‚ú®: Probably
[07/02/2022, 14:08:02] ~Talia‚ú®: It‚Äôs very sensitive
[07/02/2022, 14:08:15] ~Talia‚ú®: How can I start a women‚Äôs forum when my own boyfriend is an apologist
[07/02/2022, 14:08:20] Sabrina: The ‚Äòwhat if it were me‚Äô is a big card
[07/02/2022, 14:08:36] ~Talia‚ú®: Yeah and the answer was ‚ÄúI‚Äôd probably kill him0
[07/02/2022, 14:08:49] ~Talia‚ú®: So you can imagine my disbelief
[07/02/2022, 14:08:51] Sabrina: Then????
[07/02/2022, 14:08:56] ~Talia‚ú®: Exactly
[07/02/2022, 14:09:02] ~Talia‚ú®: I‚Äôm so upset
[07/02/2022, 14:09:17] Sabrina: I just
[07/02/2022, 14:09:26] Sabrina: It‚Äôs my line
[07/02/2022, 14:09:31] ~Talia‚ú®: It‚Äôs mine too
[07/02/2022, 14:09:54] ~Talia‚ú®: I‚Äôm beyond upset
[07/02/2022, 14:09:56] Sabrina: Hopefully he‚Äôll understand
[07/02/2022, 14:10:02] Sabrina: It hits home
[07/02/2022, 14:10:26] ~Talia‚ú®: What‚Äôs there to not understand
[07/02/2022, 14:10:33] Sabrina: I don‚Äôt know
[07/02/2022, 14:10:39] ~Talia‚ú®: Exactly
[07/02/2022, 14:10:40] Sabrina: Im really trying to give him the benefit of the doubt
[07/02/2022, 14:10:46] ~Talia‚ú®: I can‚Äôt
[07/02/2022, 14:10:49] ~Talia‚ú®: I‚Äôm sorry I can‚Äôt
[07/02/2022, 14:11:03] Sabrina: Like I don‚Äôt want this to be the reason of a break up
[07/02/2022, 14:11:07] Sabrina: Worse case scenario speaking
[07/02/2022, 14:11:19] Sabrina: So im just banking of faith that he‚Äôll come around
[07/02/2022, 14:12:04] ~Talia‚ú®: It could be mine
[07/02/2022, 14:12:03] Sabrina: Is Millie okay
[07/02/2022, 14:12:09] ~Talia‚ú®: It genuinely could be mine
[07/02/2022, 14:12:22] Sabrina: and I completely respect that
[07/02/2022, 14:12:24] ~Talia‚ú®: Idk
Seems like she encouraged the fight
[07/02/2022, 14:12:46] Sabrina: Hum
[07/02/2022, 14:12:50] Sabrina: Uhm *
[07/02/2022, 14:14:06] ~Talia‚ú®: Tbh
[07/02/2022, 14:14:22] ~Talia‚ú®: I wouldn‚Äôt be mad if someone fucked up a guy because of that
[07/02/2022, 14:14:42] Sabrina: Oh yeah same
[07/02/2022, 14:14:57] ~Talia‚ú®: I just
[07/02/2022, 14:14:57] ~Talia‚ú®: Wow
[07/02/2022, 14:15:53] ~Talia‚ú®: I wanna say to him that we probably need to have a talk because I don‚Äôt know if I can date a man that will knowingly associate with a man that has done such after claiming how he would never touch a woman and brotherhood in the college
Etc
[07/02/2022, 14:16:17] Sabrina: I was really hoping you‚Äôd say that
[07/02/2022, 14:16:26] Sabrina: Like I didn‚Äôt wanna push it
[07/02/2022, 14:16:26] ~Talia‚ú®: Yeah well
[07/02/2022, 14:16:32] ~Talia‚ú®: No it‚Äôs true
[07/02/2022, 14:16:40] Sabrina: But yeah that‚Äôs definitely needed
[07/02/2022, 14:16:44] ~Talia‚ú®: I just
[07/02/2022, 14:16:45] ~Talia‚ú®: Wow
[07/02/2022, 14:16:58] Sabrina: Like if seb did this
[07/02/2022, 14:17:25] ~Talia‚ú®: I have such an urge to speak to Adam
[07/02/2022, 14:17:29] ~Talia‚ú®: But obviously I can‚Äôt
[07/02/2022, 14:17:42] Sabrina: Oh actually Adam would‚Äôve been a great ally
[07/02/2022, 14:18:23] ~Talia‚ú®: Adam will probably still associate
[07/02/2022, 14:18:45] ~Talia‚ú®: For the sake of partying
[07/02/2022, 14:20:00] ~Talia‚ú®: I literally feel sick to my stomach
[07/02/2022, 14:20:08] ~Talia‚ú®: I‚Äôm not even being dramatic
[07/02/2022, 14:20:13] Sabrina: No I know
[07/02/2022, 14:20:18] ~Talia‚ú®: I just wow
[07/02/2022, 14:33:54] ~Talia‚ú®: And shit hit the fan
[07/02/2022, 14:33:57] ~Talia‚ú®: He replied ok
[07/02/2022, 14:38:16] Sabrina: It‚Äôs a step
[07/02/2022, 14:39:14] ~Talia‚ú®: He just replied ok
[07/02/2022, 14:39:19] ~Talia‚ú®: How is that a step
[07/02/2022, 14:39:31] Sabrina: Doesn‚Äôt it mean he‚Äôs open to talk?
[07/02/2022, 14:39:52] Sabrina: Or at the very least open to listen
[07/02/2022, 14:41:44] ~Talia‚ú®: No
[07/02/2022, 14:41:52] ~Talia‚ú®: He meant it passive aggressively
[07/02/2022, 14:41:58] ~Talia‚ú®: Like he doesn‚Äôt care
[07/02/2022, 14:42:47] Sabrina: it‚Äôs better than
‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs there to talk about‚Äô or something
[07/02/2022, 14:42:49] Sabrina: Idk
[07/02/2022, 14:42:51] Sabrina: Good luck
[07/02/2022, 14:42:58] ~Talia‚ú®: I‚Äôm not replying
[07/02/2022, 14:43:14] Sabrina: Still gonna talk to him)
[07/02/2022, 14:43:15] Sabrina: ?*
[07/02/2022, 14:43:24] ~Talia‚ú®: Maybe tomorrow
[07/02/2022, 14:43:48] ~Talia‚ú®: Not in the mood now
[07/02/2022, 14:43:52] Sabrina: Hope for the best
[07/02/2022, 14:43:59] Sabrina: Yeah I wouldn‚Äôt be either
[07/02/2022, 14:44:01] ~Talia‚ú®: What do I even say to ‚Äúok‚Äù
[07/02/2022, 14:44:23] Sabrina: Well I would go with 
Wtf is wrong with you 

But that‚Äôs just me
[07/02/2022, 14:44:37] ~Talia‚ú®: Yeah I thought about going with that too
[07/02/2022, 14:44:48] Sabrina: It would be nice wouldn‚Äôt it
[07/02/2022, 14:44:49] ~Talia‚ú®: But that won‚Äôt achieve anything
[07/02/2022, 14:44:59] Sabrina: But I just don‚Äôt want him to think you‚Äôre biased by emotion or something
[07/02/2022, 14:45:18] Sabrina: Like losing your temper propably won‚Äôt help your case with him
[07/02/2022, 14:46:25] ~Talia‚ú®: I‚Äôm just gonna say then we‚Äôre probably gonna need to have a talk on Wednesday then
[07/02/2022, 14:46:38] Sabrina: Whenever you‚Äôre ready
[07/02/2022, 14:46:44] ~Talia‚ú®: I think so
[07/02/2022, 14:47:48] ~Talia‚ú®: I said 
‚ÄúIf that‚Äôs how you wanna handle this situation. We‚Äôre gonna need to talk on Wednesday‚Äù
[07/02/2022, 14:48:06] Sabrina: I think that‚Äôs better than anything I would‚Äôve said
[07/02/2022, 14:48:20] ~Talia‚ú®: You‚Äôre bias
[07/02/2022, 14:48:27] Sabrina: I‚Äôm pissed
[07/02/2022, 14:48:35] ~Talia‚ú®: Maybe he‚Äôll realise how serious I am
[07/02/2022, 14:48:48] Sabrina: Hopefully
[07/02/2022, 14:49:33] Sabrina: I‚Äôm just making sure the facts are straight
You‚Äôre confident josh did what he did?
[07/02/2022, 14:50:00] ~Talia‚ú®: Yes
[07/02/2022, 14:50:03] ~Talia‚ú®: Caleb is too
[07/02/2022, 14:50:06] ~Talia‚ú®: He saw the messages
[07/02/2022, 14:50:17] ~Talia‚ú®: We both stood there in shock knowing it actually happened
[07/02/2022, 14:50:31] Sabrina: Excuse my language but
[07/02/2022, 14:50:35] Sabrina: Fucking hell
[07/02/2022, 14:51:01] ~Talia‚ú®: Yes
[07/02/2022, 14:51:02] ~Talia‚ú®: Exactly
[07/02/2022, 14:51:32] ~Talia‚ú®: Like it‚Äôs not just an accusation
[07/02/2022, 14:51:38] ~Talia‚ú®: there‚Äôs proof
[07/02/2022, 14:51:44] ~Talia‚ú®: Caleb knows it happens
[07/02/2022, 14:52:04] ~Talia‚ú®: Happened*^
[07/02/2022, 14:52:17] Sabrina: And you saw him react the way he did?
[07/02/2022, 14:53:12] ~Talia‚ú®: I saw him after he found out
[07/02/2022, 14:53:15] ~Talia‚ú®: He was shook it happened
[07/02/2022, 14:53:30] ~Talia‚ú®: Couldn‚Äôt believe josh did it, I said I always knew he was capable of such
[07/02/2022, 14:54:00] Sabrina: Him being capable is one thing
Him actually doing it is another
[07/02/2022, 14:54:08] ~Talia‚ú®: Yeah and he did
[07/02/2022, 14:54:16] ~Talia‚ú®: And he was going on about college brotherhood
[07/02/2022, 14:54:19] ~Talia‚ú®: And whatever
[07/02/2022, 14:54:37] Sabrina: I have no words
[07/02/2022, 14:55:08] ~Talia‚ú®: Completely disgusted
[07/02/2022, 14:55:11] ~Talia‚ú®: Hurt
[07/02/2022, 14:55:12] ~Talia‚ú®: Emotional
[07/02/2022, 14:55:30] ~Talia‚ú®: Wow
[07/02/2022, 14:55:33] Sabrina: And pissed
[07/02/2022, 14:55:39] Sabrina: Flat out pissed
[07/02/2022, 14:55:44] ~Talia‚ú®: Yes
[07/02/2022, 14:55:47] ~Talia‚ú®: Ugh
[07/02/2022, 14:56:18] ~Talia‚ú®: I knew we had different views on a lot of things
[07/02/2022, 14:56:40] ~Talia‚ú®: But I didn‚Äôt think this would be one of them
[07/02/2022, 14:57:08] Sabrina: If this isn‚Äôt his line, what is
[07/02/2022, 14:57:10] Sabrina: Besides you
[07/02/2022, 14:57:20] ~Talia‚ú®: Wdym
[07/02/2022, 14:57:50] Sabrina: If anything happened to you, without question he‚Äôd do what he had to
[07/02/2022, 14:57:56] ~Talia‚ú®: Yeah
[07/02/2022, 14:58:05] ~Talia‚ú®: But he had no problem associating
[07/02/2022, 14:58:21] ~Talia‚ú®: With someone that would do it
[07/02/2022, 14:58:29] Sabrina: That‚Äôs what I mean
[07/02/2022, 14:58:32] Sabrina: What‚Äôs his line
[07/02/2022, 14:59:01] ~Talia‚ú®: Who knows
[07/02/2022, 15:00:17] ~Talia‚ú®: And tbh
[07/02/2022, 15:00:20] ~Talia‚ú®: Do I even wanna know
[07/02/2022, 15:14:23] Sabrina: Are you willing to let him let this slide?
[07/02/2022, 15:14:36] ~Talia‚ú®: No
‚Äé[07/02/2022, 15:14:42] ~Talia‚ú®: ‚Äéimage omitted
[07/02/2022, 15:16:01] Sabrina: I wish you all the best
[07/02/2022, 15:20:06] ~Talia‚ú®: You don‚Äôt even have to call
I‚Äôll be straight up with you.
If you‚Äôre going to go around with Josh and still be besties with someone that kissed someone without consent whilst saying you‚Äôd kill someone if that happened to me. I genuinely don‚Äôt know if I can date someone that is apologetic to those types of behaviors. Especially after the conversation we‚Äôve had about abuse and how against it you were. I‚Äôve been in very close situations over the years and if my own boyfriend can still knowingly  choose to associate with a man that can do such. I‚Äôm not really sure what to do or say. 

On the other, I could be blowing this out of proportion and you could be going for other reasons. If I am blowing it out of proportion I‚Äôm more than willing to drop this.
[07/02/2022, 15:20:08] ~Talia‚ú®: Boom
[07/02/2022, 15:20:47] Sabrina: Stellar
[07/02/2022, 15:21:44] ~Talia‚ú®: Thank you
[07/02/2022, 16:37:58] ~Talia‚ú®: I fucked up
[07/02/2022, 16:38:04] ~Talia‚ú®: He was going to reprimand him
[07/02/2022, 16:38:12] ~Talia‚ú®: And I accused him of all these things
[07/02/2022, 16:38:22] ~Talia‚ú®: Now he‚Äôs pissed
[07/02/2022, 16:38:32] ~Talia‚ú®: I think he broke up with me
[07/02/2022, 19:27:41] Sabrina: Are you okay?
[08/02/2022, 07:57:07] ~Talia‚ú®: Not sure tbh
[08/02/2022, 07:58:07] ~Talia‚ú®: Kinda just letting it play out
[08/02/2022, 09:46:55] Sabrina: I don‚Äôt think either of you are completely in the wrong
[08/02/2022, 09:54:02] ~Talia‚ú®: I just jumped to conclusions
[08/02/2022, 09:55:50] Sabrina: Tbf you only did that because he didn‚Äôt do anything to suggest that he was going to do anything
[08/02/2022, 09:57:30] ~Talia‚ú®: And be said he‚Äôs not answerable to me and I should‚Äôve given him the decency to ask
[08/02/2022, 09:57:55] Sabrina: He said reprimand though
[08/02/2022, 10:36:34] ~Talia‚ú®: Wdym
[08/02/2022, 10:45:34] Sabrina: We both would‚Äôve cut off all ties without question
[08/02/2022, 10:45:49] Sabrina: This feels a bit like settling
[08/02/2022, 15:27:17] ~Talia‚ú®: Yeah he said they wanted him to admit it to his face and then they are never gonna talk to him again
[08/02/2022, 15:27:25] ~Talia‚ú®: I feel like shit
[08/02/2022, 15:27:32] ~Talia‚ú®: I assumed the worst from him

[09/02/2022, 11:25:13] ~Talia‚ú®: Am I being inconsiderate
[09/02/2022, 11:25:20] Sabrina: No
[09/02/2022, 11:25:24] ~Talia‚ú®: Or like is he being dramatic
[09/02/2022, 11:25:33] ~Talia‚ú®: He was like I brought back PTSD
[09/02/2022, 11:25:35] Sabrina: He‚Äôs being a bit narrow minded
